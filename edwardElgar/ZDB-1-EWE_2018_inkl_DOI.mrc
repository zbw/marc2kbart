This book captures leading and thought-provoking conceptual and empirical contributions on how organizations (ought to) interact with such natural resources. Utilizing a distinctly managerial approach, the chapter authors explore topics such as interorganizational relationships, strategic responses, and risk and resilience at the interface of the natural environment. By applying and extending management theories such as resource dependence, transaction costs, the resource-based view, dynamic capabilities and imprinting in a natural resource context, the authors open up multiple avenues for future research. At the same time, they seek to actively build a global community of management scholars interested in natural resources. Multidisciplinary in approach and clear in execution, this book will be of interest to students and researchers studying natural resource management and policy, policymakers from regional, national, and transnational bodies, as well as leaders of environment focused NGOs.  aDescription based on print record. 0aNatural resources. 0aNatural resources management areas. 0aElectronic books.1 aGeorge, Gerard,eeditor.1 aSchillebeeckx, J.

This book addresses this important, and usually hidden, aspect of research by providing students and researchers with insider insights, advice and lessons about the difficulties in the research process. Written by experienced researchers, PhD supervisors and examiners, it should prepare the reader for all that can go wrong when researching a PhD or any large research project. The starting point of each chapter is the acceptance that research projects do not always go smoothly. Researchers must find ways to jump through a myriad of invisible hoops and over a plethora of hurdles of unknown heights to guide their research, from conceptualisation of worthwhile projects to the completion and dissemination to a range of different audiences. The book is divided into four sections: 'getting started', 'getting data', 'getting it together', and 'getting finished'. Each section comprises chapters followed by short vignettes - all of which offer insights into researchers facing real-world problems or not quite getting things right in the first instance. This ground breaking book will give hope to the early-career researcher, the PhD or Masters student, and provide experienced academics with reinvigoration and new perspectives on the research process.  aDescription based on print record. 0aResearchxMethodology. 0aElectronic books.1 aTownsend, Keith,eeditor.1 aSaunders, M.

Drawing on contemporary research, this Handbook provides a provocative review of the major human resource challenges facing the hospitality and tourism sector today. Leading international scholars examine how hospitality and tourism businesses succeed through a consistently high level of service, particularly through the attitudes and behaviours of front-line employees to positively impact upon guest satisfaction and improve intention to return. Against this background, chapters analyse the myriad of reasons the industry struggles to attract and retain quality employees, including long and unsocial hours, non-competitive pay and unsophisticated management practices. Offering a thorough review of these human resource challenges through employee focus groups, in-depth interviews and surveys, this Handbook offers evidence-informed recommendations for their resolution. These include: strategies and tactics associated with brand internalisation, talent management, engagement, high-performance practices, learning and leadership development. Practical and engaging, this Handbook will be of interest to students and scholars researching hospitality and tourism from a business management perspective. Senior hospitality leaders will also benefit from the ideas herein, gaining competitive advantage by creating and supporting highly engaged and effective employees.  aDescription based on print record. 0aHospitality industry. 0aTourismxEmployees. 0aElectronic books.1 aBurke, Ronald J.,eeditor.1 aChristensen Hughes, Julia,d1959-eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786431363 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786431363.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864313707 a10.4337/97817864313702doi05720nam  22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184245039000204264005500594300003500649336002600684337002600710338003600736490005000772500002000822505303600842520097103878588003904849650003904888650002004927655002204947700003804969700003705007700002805044700002805072710004105100776002905141856005505170856004205225024003105267eep9781784711825UtOrBLW20180115070621.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170726s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781784711825 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD60b.R47 201800aResearch handbook on small business social responsibility :bglobal perspectives /cedited by Laura J.

Addressing the weakness of current CSR research, this Research Handbook provides a unique perspective on small business social responsibility in both the developed and developing world. Bringing together leading international experts, and including a foreword by R. Edward Freeman, this Research Handbook defines and contextualizes CSR in small businesses across the globe. It explores issues surrounding supply chains, responsible finance, and social enterprise, offering both practitioner insights and succinct case studies to go beyond the usual Western perspective and enable a globally relevant understanding of small business social responsibility. This Research Handbook will be an invaluable tool for researchers and educators, as well as for students of business and CSR, social enterprise, development and management.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSocial responsibility of business. 0aSmall business. 0aElectronic books.1 aSpence, Laura J.,d1968-eeditor.1 aFrynas, Jedrzej George,eeditor.1 aMuthuri, Judy,eeditor.1 aNavare, Jyoti,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781784711818 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781784711818.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817847118257 a10.4337/97817847118252doi04439nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245030500205264005500510300003500565336002600600337002600626338003600652490002700688500002000715505155400735520137402289588003903663650002003702655002203722700004003744700003103784710004103815776002903856830002803885856005503913856004203968024003104010eep9781784716813UtOrBLW20180115070621.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170726s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781784716813 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB615b.R47 201802aA research agenda for entrepreneurial cognition and intention /cedited by Malin Brännback (Dean and Professor of International Business), and Alan L.

Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. A Research Agenda for Entrepreneurial Cognition and Intention suggests new directions and approaches to study the internal thought processes of entrepreneurs by examining areas that have been under-researched, ignored or overlooked. Proposing new views on the idea of an entrepreneurial personality, new methodologies and theories of cognition and influence of personality, the contributors go beyond the study of individual intentions to evaluate group intentions. Furthermore, the book proposes that current research methods limit our understanding of entrepreneurial processes by not connecting to the wider entrepreneurial audience. With this in mind, key chapters focus on the role and relevance of language and gender in entrepreneurship. Academic researchers and advanced students looking to explore the latest research methods and statistical approaches will find this Research Agenda extremely useful for creating new research pathways. The case studies will also be exceptionally useful for those with a wider interest in entrepreneurship and those who wish to have a greater understanding of entrepreneurial intention.  aDescription based on print record. 0aBusinesspeople. 0aElectronic books.1 aBrännback, Malin,d1963-eeditor.1 aCarsrud, Alan L.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781784716806 (hardback) 0aElgar research agendas.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781784716806.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817847168137 a10.4337/97817847168132doi05758nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245028700205264005500492300003500547336002600582337002600608338003600634490005000670500002000720505295500740520129603695588003904991650002005030650001605050655002205066700004205088700003205130710004105162776002905203856005505232856004205287024003105329eep9781783473762UtOrBLW20180115070621.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170627s2017    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781783473762 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB615b.R47 201700aResearch handbook on entrepreneurship and leadership /cedited by Richard T.

This book argues that the study of entrepreneurs as leaders is a gap in both the leadership and the entrepreneurship literatures. The impact of leaders is a crucial factor in the success or failure of smaller entrepreneurial firms and has implications for our understanding of new venture viability and growth. Featuring conceptual and empirical chapters from a wide range of cultures and entrepreneurship and leadership ecosystems, this Research Handbook is the first of its kind to present a systematic overview of the entrepreneurial leadership field, providing a state-of-the-art perspective and highlighting unanswered questions and opportunities for further research. It consolidates existing theory development, stimulates new conceptual thinking and includes path-breaking empirical explorations. With its international perspective illustrating the practice of entrepreneurial leadership in a wide range of organizational contexts, the Research Handbook on Entrepreneurship and Leadership offers an essential reference to students and researchers in entrepreneurship and leadership alike.  aDescription based on print record. 0aBusinesspeople. 0aLeadership. 0aElectronic books.1 aHarrison, Richard T.,d1955-eeditor.1 aLeitch, Claire M.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781783473755 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781783473755.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817834737627 a10.4337/97817834737622doi03630nam  22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002300184100003700207245026300244264005500507300003400562336002600596337002600622338003600648500002000684505104200704520118401746588003902930650002402969650002902993655002203022710004103044776002903085856006903114856004203183024003103225eep9781785366383UtOrBLW20180115070621.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170726s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781785366383 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD30.28b.K63 20181 aKodama, Mitsuru,d1957-eauthor.10aSustainable growth through strategic innovation :bdriving congruence in capabilities /cMitsuru Kodama (Professor of Innovation and Technology Management, College of Commerce and Graduate School of Business Administration, Nihon University at Tokyo, Japan). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2018.  a1 online resource (256 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: 1.

Through detailed reviews of existing dynamic capabilities and in-depth case studies, this book presents a theoretical model of a strategic innovation system to enable a large company to maintain its competitiveness and establish sustainable growth. Companies studied include Apple, Sony, Cisco, Fujifilm and SoftBank. Large corporations have to be innovators that can reinforce their positions through incremental innovation, while constantly renewing or destroying existing business through radical innovation. To achieve this, Mitsuru Kodama presents the concept of "capabilities congruence" - a business factor in large corporations that brings about sustainable growth over the long term by achieving strategic innovation as the corporation enacts dynamic capabilities and strategic innovation capabilities. Sustainable Growth Through Strategic Innovation offers fresh insights to academics, researchers and students in business and management. It is also intended to provide practical guidance to leaders and managers in the broader business environment.  aDescription based on print record. 0aStrategic planning. 0aSustainable development. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781785366376 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781785366376/9781785366376.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817853663837 a10.4337/97817853663832doi04227nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245035000206264005500556300003500611336002600646337002600672338003600698490002700734500002000761505141300781520123902194588003903433650001903472655002203491700005803513700003203571710004103603776002903644830002803673856005503701856004203756024003103798eep9781785365379UtOrBLW20180115070621.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170726s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781785365379 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD6054b.R47 201802aA research agenda for women and entrepreneurship :bidentity through aspirations, behaviors, and confidence /cedited by Patricia G.

Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. This book looks at long-studied questions of identity from the perspective of women entrepreneurs, exploring ideas related to entrepreneurial identity for women and their businesses. The editors map out a vision for research on women and entrepreneurship and discuss aspiration, behaviors and confidence as key concepts that shape and enhance a woman's identity in the entrepreneurial process. A global collection of authors who are passionate about identity and women's entrepreneurship bring a variety of theoretical perspectives and quantitative methodologies to the table. Through a common framework of on women business owners and their businesses, they delve into social identity, start-ups, crowdfunding and context to set the groundwork for future research on entrepreneurship and gender. Advanced graduate students and researchers in the field of entrepreneurship will appreciate this focused exploration of a compelling topic, as will doctoral students and scholars of women's issues.  aDescription based on print record. 0aBusinesswomen. 0aElectronic books.1 aGreene, Patricia G.q(Patricia Gene),d1954-eeditor.1 aBrush, Candida G.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781785365362 (hardback) 0aElgar research agendas.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781785365362.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817853653797 a10.4337/97817853653792doi04428nam  22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245022300206264006300429300003500492336002600527337002600553338003600579490003300615500002000648505156300668520140602231588003903637650001603676650000903692655002203701700003103723700003203754710004103786776002903827830003403856856005503890856004203945024003103987eep9781786438652UtOrBLW20180227130636.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170726s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786438652 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD57.7b.L43 201800aLeadership and sexuality :bpower, principles and processes /cedited by James K.

Leadership and Sexuality: Power, Principles, and Processes is a scholarly synthesis of leadership principles with issues related to sexuality and sexual policy-making. The authors' multi-disciplinary analysis of the topic examines sexuality in the context of many different kinds of leadership, exploring both the good and the bad aspects of leadership and sexuality. These integrated topics are examined through three broad areas of study. The first involves individuals who become leaders in sexual domains by advancing new views of human sexuality. The second involves problems that leaders of businesses and other institutions must address as a result of issues related to human sexuality, including sexual harassment and sexually-based discrimination in the workplace. The third area involves understanding how being a leader influences sexual desire and sexual attraction, and may impact the course of workplace romance and the expression of sexuality. Written to be accessible to both laypeople and scholars, this book will appeal to academics and scientists interested in human sexuality as well as many related disciplines, including psychology, sociology, leadership studies, heroism science, political science, religion, and economics.   aDescription based on print record. 0aLeadership. 0aSex. 0aElectronic books.1 aBeggan, James K.,eeditor.1 aAllison, Scott T.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786438645 (hardback) 0aJepson studies in leadership.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786438645.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864386527 a10.4337/97817864386522doi05847nam  22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245095600206264006301162300003401225336002601259337002601285338003601311500002001347505240001367520117803767588003904945650001904984655002205003700005505025700002905080700003005109700002905139700002805168700003105196710004105227776002905268856005505297856004205352024003105394eep9781786434500UtOrBLW20180227130636.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||171031s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786434500 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD6053b.W66 201800aWomen entrepreneurship and the myth of 'underperformance' :ba new look at women's entrepreneurship research /cedited by Shumaila Yousafzai (Reader in Entrepreneurship, Cardiff Business School, Cardiff University, UK), Alain Fayolle (Professor of Entrepreneurship and Director, Entrepreneurship Research Centre, EMLYON Business School, Ecully, France), Adam Lindgreen (Professor of Marketing and Head of Department, Copenhagen Business School, Denmark and Research Associate, Gordon Institute of Business Science, University of Pretoria, South Africa), Colette Henry (Head of School of Business and Humanities, Dundalk Institute of Technology, Ireland and Adjunct Professor of Entrepreneurship, UiTThe Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø, Norway), Saadat Saeed (Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship, Durham University Business School, Durham University), and Shandana Sheikh (Doctoral Researcher, Cardiff Business School, Cardiff University, UK). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Publishing Limited,c2018.  a1 online resource (288 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Part I Performance, success and value in entrepreneurship: a women's perspective -- 1.

Significantly, this book adds a critical perspective to defining 'success' and 'performance', shattering misconceptions of underperformance in women-owned enterprises. The contributing authors raise questions on the limiting concept of the 'entrepreneur' and have valuable insights into policies to facilitate female entrepreneurs. Instead of taking a one-sided and narrow approach with regards to understanding the entrepreneurship performance phenomenon, this book argues that future researchers should take a fresh look at business performance, considering structural constraints, definitions of success and other socio-political factors. Scholars in the fields of entrepreneurship, gender studies, and institutional theory, as well as those who have a general interest in critical research, will benefit from this progressive step in entrepreneurship research.   aDescription based on print record. 0aBusinesswomen. 0aElectronic books.1 aYousafzai, Shumaila Y.q(Shumaila Yakub),eeditor.1 aFayolle, Alain,eeditor.1 aLindgreen, Adam,eeditor.1 aHenry, Colette,eeditor.1 aSaeed, Saadat,eeditor.1 aSheikh, Shandana,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786434494 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786434494.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864345007 a10.4337/97817864345002doi03556nam  22003615i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002400184245018200208264006300390300003400453336002600487337002600513338003600539500002000575505107600595520116701671588003902838650004902877655002202926700003402948710004102982776002903023856006903052856004203121024003103163eep9781788110068UtOrBLW20180227130637.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170726s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788110068 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD2755.5b.M85 201804aThe multinational enterprise :btheory and history /cMark Casson (Professor of Economics and Director, Centre for Institutions and Economic History, University of Reading, UK). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Publishing Limited,c2018.  a1 online resource (368 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Preface -- PART I Introduction and overview -- 1.

He shows how recent developments in theory shed new light on the historical emergence of multinational enterprises, and explains the various forms that multinationality has taken in different industries and regions of the world. Mark Casson brings together his leading research on internalisation theory as a general theory of the multinational enterprise. He offers cutting-edge analysis across four distinct sections: marketing and brands, supply chain coordination, methodology and the theory of the firm, and risk management. The book also sets out an exciting new research agenda, which explores the future place of the multinational in the evolving 'knowledge economy' and in a politically uncertain world. This book will appeal to doctoral students and faculty in business schools in need of the latest theoretical developments and also those in economics departments that specialise in business and industrial economics.   aDescription based on print record. 0aInternational business enterprisesxHistory. 0aElectronic books.1 aCasson, Mark,d1945-eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788110051 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788110051/9781788110051.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881100687 a10.4337/97817881100682doi04164nam  22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002100196245032300217264006300540300003500603336002600638337002600664338003600690490004300726500002000769505126900789520131102058588003903369650003003408655002203438700002603460700003903486700003103525710004103556776002903597856005503626856004203681024003103723eep9781788110990UtOrBLW20180227130637.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170726s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788110990 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  ae------ 4aHB615b.D96 201804aThe dynamics of entrepreneurial contexts :bfrontiers in European entrepreneurship research /cEdited by Ulla Hytti (Research Director, University of Turku, Finland), Robert Blackburn (Professor, Kingston University, UK), and Silke Tegtmeier (Associate Professor, University of Southern Denmark, Sønderborg, Denmark). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Publishing Limited,c2018.  a1 online resource (224 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aFrontiers in European entrepreneurship  aIncludes index.0 aContents: 1.

This book compellingly demonstrates the ways in which the distinctive European cultural, societal and geographic environments enable research into new entrepreneurial phenomena. It also gives guidance as to how future research should endeavour to understand the influences of context. The Dynamics of Entrepreneurial Contexts explores the European methodological diversity encompassing various academic disciplines and research paradigms. Contributors suggest European entrepreneurship research should give priority to the local and individual to enable new research questions that are resonant with context. Finally, the book welcomes critical analyses of entrepreneurship that aim at questioning the taken-for-granted assumptions and analyses that increase our understanding of the counterproductive forms of entrepreneurship. Providing a unique insight into the emerging topics of entrepreneurship research, both European and international researchers will benefit from the different analytical and methodological perspectives provided to understand the differences, similarities and configurations of context. With a variety of regional and industry examples, postgraduates will significantly benefit from the overview of new and important research.   aDescription based on print record. 0aEntrepreneurshipzEurope. 0aElectronic books.1 aHytti, Ulla,eeditor.1 aBlackburn, Robert,d1952-eeditor.1 aTegtmeier, Silke,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788110983 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788110983.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881109907 a10.4337/97817881109902doi04912nam  22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002600184245028100210264006300491300003400554336002600588337002600614338003600640490005000676500002000726505238200746520106003128588003904188650001804227655002204245700003104267700003004298710004104328776002904369856005504398856004204453024003104495eep9781784718152UtOrBLW20180227130636.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170726s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781784718152 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF5415.153b.H36 201800aHandbook of research on new product development /cedited by Peter N.

This analysis is conducted at global system level, at the level of global value chains and for individual firms. These three levels represent consistent, nested approaches to the analysis of pressing issues of the modern international economy. The Global Factory examines the internalisation theory of the multinational enterprise as it applies to global interfirm networks, and pays particular attention to multinational firms from emerging countries. It examines the governance and performance of global factories, their internationalisation and knowledge management strategies and the potential for multinational firms to address societal failures. The role of technology, the use of tax havens by Chinese multinationals and the division of entrepreneurial labour between global factories and smaller local firms are all explored as fascinating aspects of the overarching theory. This is an essential point of reference on Buckley's work on the global factory for academics and students of business, as well as managers of multinational firms and public policy makers.  aDescription based on print record. 0aInternational business enterprises. 0aGlobalization. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786431325 (hardback) 0aNew horizons in international business.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786431325.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864313327 a10.4337/97817864313322doi03077nam  22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184100003700205245010400242264004900346300003400395336002600429337002600455338003600481504005100517505053700568520128801105588003902393650002202432650001502454655002202469710004102491776002902532856006902561856004202630024003102672eep9781786438959UtOrBLW20180320080630.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170823s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781786438959 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB615b.B54 20181 aBjerke, Björn,d1941-eauthor.10aAlternative marketing approaches for entrepreneurs /cBjörn Bjerke (Linnaeus University, Sweden). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2018.  a1 online resource (320 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: 1.

By assessing customers as active agents rather than passive consumers, Björn Bjerke explores alternative ways of marketing for new businesses and social entrepreneurial ventures. This book first presents the dominant approach to marketing theory used for the last half a century. After that, it presents an alternative approach to marketing theory by emphasizing how new infrastructures and organizations, including online platforms, influence new ways of linking the formal and informal economies together. Building on fundamental theories of science and methodological issues, Bjerke creates useful theoretical conceptions that can develop a greater connection between practice and research. He argues that as entrepreneurial activity is more accessible than ever it needs a fresh approach to include customers as co-creators and co-extractors of market value. An excellent book for exploring alternative marketing, students and researchers in marketing, social entrepreneurship and wider business and management studies will gain a greater understanding of what it means to be a marketer, customer and user.   aDescription based on print record. 0aEntrepreneurship. 0aMarketing. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786438942 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786438942/9781786438942.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864389597 a10.4337/97817864389592doi06614nam  22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002600184245043700210264004900647300003500696336002600731337002600757338003600783490005700819505409300876520091404969588003905883650003205922655002205954700002905976700003706005710004106042776002906083856005506112856004206167024003106209eep9781784716752UtOrBLW20180320080629.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170726s2018    mau     o     000 0 eng    a9781784716752 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF5415.125b.H36 201800aHandbook of marketing analytics :bmethods and applications in marketing management, public policy, and litigation support /cedited by Natalie Mizik (Professor of Marketing and J.

The book uses different traditions and modes of critique to interrogate, disrupt and reimagine the concept of social entrepreneurship. Presented in five parts, each individual contribution uses a different critical perspective to analyse and assess social entrepreneurship in its mythological, ideological and performative constitution, looking for its democratic possibilities and alternative affirmations. Using varied analytical approaches, the resulting work highlights the need for a greater recognition of the unintended effects of social entrepreneurship and in doing so, adds nuance to a concept that has gone relatively unchallenged. In addition, each chapter identifies intriguing points for further research. Scholars in the fields of social entrepreneurship, management and organizational studies will find this a relevant and insightful work. Those with a wider scholarly interest in critical research, particularly in the humanities or social sciences, will also find the critical approaches compelling.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSocial entrepreneurship. 0aElectronic books.1 aDey, Pascal,eeditor.1 aSteyaert, Chris,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781783474110 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781783474110.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817834741277 a10.4337/97817834741272doi07679nam  22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184245024900204264004900453300003400502336002600536337002600562338003600588500002000624505377200644520240004416588003906816650003906855650001306894650002006907655002206927700003006949700003106979700004007010710004107050776002907091856007607120856004207196024003107238eep9781786432636UtOrBLW20180425130130.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170914s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786432636 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD60b.R47 201800aResearch handbook of finance and sustainability /cedited by Sabri Boubaker (South Champagne Business School, France), Douglas Cumming (Schulich School of Business, York University, Canada), and Duc Khuong Nguyen (IPAG Business School, France). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2018.  a1 online resource (680 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Part I Corporate social responsibility -- 1.

A traditional stand and lecture approach to teaching this complex subject does not always suffice, and many professors are finding that students benefit more from hands-on experiences. By engaging and acting, students can own their knowledge and progress beyond an intellectual understanding of the subject. This book offers sixty-five experiential exercises, each designed to be applicable to the entrepreneurial process. These cross-disciplinary exercises vary in scale from single-class activities to course projects or yearlong capstones. Learning objectives are clearly defined so that instructors can incorporate the book's exercises, games, simulations and demonstrations into their syllabi. Whether classes are basic, intermediate or advanced, instructors can use the exercises to engage their students and help them develop as creatively-minded entrepreneurs.

This timely and insightful book draws from several disciplines including the organizational sciences, neuroeconomics, cognitive psychology, social cognitive neuroscience and neuroscience to review the neuroscientific methods and techniques that organizational scholars can use to study the neural basis of organizational behavior. The topics discussed include the neural foundations of decision-making, leadership, fairness, trust and cooperation, emotions, ethics and morality, unconscious bias and diversity in the workplace. Organizational neuroscience can provide valuable insights for organizational scholars to develop new theories, refine existing theories, ask new questions or reformulate old questions.

Leading experts challenge the assumption that there are consistent solutions for managing human resources across nations. Valuing the importance of context, particularly at a national and regional level, the chapter authors question the 'best practice' solutions by discussing theoretical, issue-based and regional-based distinctions in HRM. New to this edition: an extended focus on the most essential theoretical underpinnings of CHRM including an anthropological comparative method; additional in-depth studies in comparative areas covering the range of current HRM practice, including sustainable HRM; a broader set of countries and regions now including Central and South America, North and Sub-Saharan Africa, and Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, to create the most comprehensive global coverage of comparative CHRM research.

This book compares the success of accelerators in comparison to the independent growth of new companies or incubators through a series of in-depth studies. Accelerators: Successful Venture Creation and Growth examines how the organisational structures and practices of start-up accelerators generate innovations and identify new technologies, products and services. Mike Wright and Israel Drori have developed an entrepreneurial approach to this topic, exploring accelerators and start-ups as temporary organisations. This allows the contributing authors to highlight issues relating to both internal and external processes. This book focuses on an important entrepreneurship trend that is growing, but has not yet undergone thorough research, and as such, is key for anyone wishing to understand the topic. This would be a stimulating and valuable read for entrepreneurs, policymakers and students looking to enter accelerators.  aDescription based on print record. 0aNew business enterprises. 0aBusiness incubators. 0aElectronic books.1 aWright, Mikec(Professor of management science),eeditor.1 aDrori, Israel,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786434081 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786434081/9781786434081.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864340987 a10.4337/97817864340982doi06204nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002600184245025400210264005500464300003500519336002600554337002600580338003600606490003100642500002000673505360500693520109004298588003905388650003205427655002205459700004105481700003305522710004105555776002905596830003205625856007605657856004205733024003105775eep9781785365607UtOrBLW20180521061638.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||171106s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781785365607 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF5549.5.M5bR47 201800aResearch handbook of diversity and careers /cedited by Adelina M.

This work includes cross-disciplinary contributions from over 50 international academics, researchers, policy-makers, managers and psychologists, who review current thinking, practices, initiatives and developments within diversity and careers research on an international scale. They also consider the implication of diversity legislation for organizations and the individual, providing an insight into the future direction of research and practice. Unlike other research in the field, this work presents wide-ranging and holistic coverage of diverse groups in addition to considering the implication of individuals who appear in multiple categories.

Despite years of study by academic researchers and industry practitioners, there still remains a need to draw a clear and established connection between decision making and performance. By closely examining consequential business decisions made by key executives, this book offers a better understanding of business performance and recommendations for improved business practices. Through the use of case studies and interviews with business leaders based on 17 theorized measures of performance, this breakthrough study not only clarifies the impact of decisions on business performance, but also defines and distinguishes decisions that lead to successful and unsuccessful performance. Recommendations are made to optimize decision making for businesses of all sizes and projections about the future of decision making and performance are provided. This book can be used both as a reference source for academic researchers and students seeking further research on the subject, and as a practical guide for leaders and business professionals seeking advancement and better decision making within the industry.  aDescription based on print record. 0aDecision making. 0aElectronic books.1 aLopes, Carlos J.,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786430151 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786430151/9781786430151.xml 0aNew horizons in management.40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864301687 a10.4337/97817864301682doi04303nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002600184100003900210245043500249264005500684300003500739336002600774337002600800338003600826490003100862504005100893505120700944520139602151588003903547650002603586655002203612700002703634710004103661776002903702830003203731856006903763856004203832024003103874eep9781788115216UtOrBLW20180614122138.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788115216 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF5549.5.R3bT95 20181 aTziner, Aharon E.,d1950-eauthor.10aImproving performance appraisal at work :bevolution and change /cAharon Tziner (Full Professor of Management (OB & HRM) and Organizational Psychology and Senior Vice-Rector and Former Dean, Schools of Business Administration and Behavioral Studies, Netanya Academic College), and Edna Rabenu (Senior Lecturer of Management (OB & HRM), Schools of Behavioral Studies and Business Administration, Netanya Academic College, Israel). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (264 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aNew horizons in management  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Preface -- Part I Performance appraisal: a primer -- 1.

Looking forward, Aharon Tziner and Edna Rabenu emphasize that well-conducted appraisals combine a mixture of classic and current, and are here to stay. The book first presents a primer to performance appraisals, covering the role of management, the appraisers, and external and political influences. The authors then present ways to improve the appraisal system through training, methodology and diversification. Consequently, they outline the key questions and opportunities facing the research and business communities, including the rapidly developing technological and democratic workforce. In particular, the authors highlight the need for the creation of a "climate of performance" and innovation in research, for the betterment of both the individual employee and society as a whole. Improving Performance Appraisal at Work is a comprehensive guide for researchers in business and management, human resource management and organizational behavior. The authors cover an extensive array of issues relating to the role of employee performance appraisal, making this book an excellent advisory text for those in professional human resource roles.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEmployeesxRating of. 0aElectronic books.1 aRabenu, Edna,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788115209 (hardback) 0aNew horizons in management.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788115209/9781788115209.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881152167 a10.4337/97817881152162doi03537nam  22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002500184245016900209264005500378300003400433336002600467337002600493338003600519500002000555505097700575520116601552588003902718650006202757650001702819655002202836700003302858700004102891710004102932776002902973856007603002856004203078024003103120eep9781788117197UtOrBLW20180614122138.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788117197 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aBR115.C67b.S48 201800aSeven deadly sins in consumption /cedited by Henna Syrjälä and Hanna Leipämaa-Leskinen (School of Marketing and Communication, University of Vaasa, Finland). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (176 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Introduction / Henna Syrjälä and Hanna Leipämaa-Leskinen -- 1.

Sloth: conceptualizing the experience sloth in the convenience seeking consumption / Ari Huuhka and Harri Luomala -- Index.  aOffering a novel view on morality in consumption, this book creatively examines how the seven deadly sins - pride, greed, lust, gluttony, envy, wrath, and sloth - are embodied in contemporary consumer society. Each of the seven chapters summarizes previous literature of the sins across disciplinary boundaries, and explores how consumption is likely to change in the future. The sins are presented as social, historical, cultural and political constructs, relying on the underlying assumptions of cultural consumer research. Each is elaborated on within particular consumption and marketing-related spheres, including advertising, retail environment, convenience food consumption, poverty, and ethical consumption. Consequently, the book provides a new way to understand contemporary consumer culture. Although beginning with the dark notions of sinfulness, the authors conclude with a hopeful tone for positive transformations in consumption. This fascinating book will be of significant interest to consumer researchers and post-graduate students studying the effects of consumption in social science disciplines, including marketing, business and sociology.  aDescription based on print record. 0aConsumption (Economics)xReligious aspectsxChristianity. 0aDeadly sins. 0aElectronic books.1 aSyrjälä, Henna,eeditor.1 aLeipämaa-Leskinen, Hanna,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788117180 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788117180/9781788117180.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881171977 a10.4337/97817881171972doi05738nam  22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245038700206250002000593264005500613300003500668336002600703337002600729338003600755490005000791500002000841505222400861520171903085588003904804650004104843650004704884650005404931655002204985700005205007700003805059710004105097776002905138856007605167856004205243024003105285eep9781785363528UtOrBLW20180614122137.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781785363528 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD62.6b.H36 201800aHandbook of research on nonprofit economics and management /cedited by Bruce A.

This Handbook explores the frontiers of knowledge at the intersection of economics and the management of these entities. Top researchers in the field review the role, structure, and behavior of private nonprofit organizations as economic units and their participation in markets and systems of public service delivery, assess the implications of this knowledge for the efficient management of nonprofit organizations and the formulation of effective public policy, and identify cutting-edge questions for future research. Building on the success of the first edition, this thoroughly revised and expanded edition explores: (1) areas of general agreement from previous research; (2) areas of conflicting results and unexplored questions; (3) the relative roles of theory, data availability, and empirical analysis in explaining gaps in our knowledge; and (4) what must be done to improve our knowledge and extend the literature. Selected original chapters addressing especially challenging topics include: the value of risk management to nonprofit decision-making; nonprofit wages theory and evidence; the valuation of volunteer labor; property tax exemption for non-profits; when is competition good for the third sector; product diversification and social enterprise; international perspectives; the application of experimental research; and the macroeconomic effects of the nonprofit sector. This book is a valuable resource for academics, but the concerns of nonprofit sector managers and decision-makers are also addressed, making it a useful reference for practitioners as well.  aDescription based on print record. 0aNonprofit organizationsxManagement. 0aNonprofit organizationsxEconomic aspects. 0aNonprofit organizationsvHandbooks, manuals, etc. 0aElectronic books.1 aSeaman, Bruce A.q(Bruce Alan),d1949-eeditor.1 aYoung, Dennis R.,d1943-eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781785363511 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781785363511/9781785363511.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817853635287 a10.4337/97817853635282doi04673nam  22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245056400205264005500769300003500824336002600859337002600885338003600911490005700947505152001004520119102524588003903715650002203754650003003776655002203806700003503828700004803863700003303911700003003944710004103974776002904015830005804044856007604102856004204178024003104220eep9781784710064UtOrBLW20180614122137.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     o     000 0 eng    a9781784710064 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB615b.E58 201800aEntrepreneurial ecosystems and the diffusion of startups /cedited by Elias G.

Given that individuals spend much of their day in the workplace, it is crucial to understand both their behaviours and the potential impact they can have on the company's environmental performance and the environment. Bringing together leading academics from various research fields, this Handbook examines the features and challenges within the area of employee pro-environmental behaviour. The Research Handbook on Employee Pro-Environmental Behaviour brings contributions that consolidate existing research in the field as well as adding new insights from organisational psychology, human resource management and social marketing. Drawing on studies from across the methodological spectrum, this Handbook covers a broad range of topics from the antecedents and consequences of employee pro-environmental behaviour to ways in which employers can encourage pro-environmental behaviour. This Handbook will be an invaluable tool for those engaged in research in employee environmental behaviour and sustainability. It will be especially useful for postgraduate students of environmental employee behaviour as well as environmental consultants and practitioners seeking to gain an understanding of employee behaviour.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEnvironmental management. 0aEmployee motivation. 0aElectronic books.1 aWells, Victoria K.,eeditor.1 aGregory-Smith, Diana,eeditor.1 aManika, Danae,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786432827 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786432827/9781786432827.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864328347 a10.4337/97817864328342doi04523nam  22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245020400205264005500409300003500464336002600499337002600525338003600551490002700587500002000614505195400634520117002588588003903758650004203797655002203839700002903861710004103890776002903931830002803960856007603988856004204064024003104106eep9781786432919UtOrBLW20180614122138.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786432919 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB615b.R47 201802aA research agenda for entrepreneurship /cedited by Alain Fayolle (Distinguished Professor of Entrepreneurship and Director, Entrepreneurship Research Centre, EMLYON Business School, Ecully, France). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (336 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aElgar research agendas  aIncludes index.0 aContents: 1.

Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. Edited by Alain Fayolle, this Research Agenda tackles the need for additional and robust intellectual foundations in entrepreneurship education, both at theoretical and methodological levels. The authors show that it is essential to connect entrepreneurship education more firmly with societal demands. Identifying two key issues, the eminent authors first question what the current pedagogies and practices in entrepreneurship education are. Secondly, the authors question what is known about the relevancy, usefulness and efficiency of the current practices in entrepreneurship education. This book calls for a pragmatic and critical approach in the development of perspectives in entrepreneurship education. This book presents innovative ideas and provocative contributions to the debate with the intention of generating significant new concepts for future researchers, policy makers and practitioners in entrepreneurship.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEntrepreneurshipxStudy and teaching. 0aElectronic books.1 aFayolle, Alain,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786432902 (hardback) 0aElgar research agendas.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786432902/9781786432902.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864329197 a10.4337/97817864329192doi04026nam  22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245065200205264005500857300003400912336002600946337002600972338003600998500002001034505097101054520120302025588003903228650003903267655002203306700003003328700003003358700003303388710004103421776002903462856007603491856004203567024003103609eep9781785368752UtOrBLW20180614122137.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781785368752 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHM786b.O75 201800aOrigins of organizing /cedited by Tuomo Peltonen (Professor of Organization and Management, Faculty of Social Sciences, Business and Economics, Åbo Akademi University, Finland), Hugo Gaggiotti (Associate Professor of Organization Studies, Bristol Business School, University of the West of England, UK and Visiting Professor, Robert Heilbroner Center for Capitalism Studies, New School for Social Research, New York, US), and Peter Case (Professor of Organization Studies, Bristol Business School, University of the West of England, UK and Professor of Management and Organization Studies, School of Business, James Cook University, Australia). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (200 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Introduction: in search of alternative origins of organizing / Tuomo Peltonen, Hugo Gaggiotti and Peter Case -- Part I Theoretical origins -- 1.

Here, the authors address a gap in current literature by exploring previously unrecognized or marginalized global origins in both modern and ancient history. This innovative collection of original, research-based work covers a variety of historical epochs and theoretical streams from ancient civilizations to modern movements in philosophy and the social sciences. Among other topics, the chapters evaluate ideas of organizing by Quakers, 16th-century Jesuits and communities in the Roman Empire and ancient China. The authors creatively and insightfully engage with the historiography and philosophy of organizing, presenting alternatives to the dominant Western-focused development of organizational theory and practice. Origins of Organizing is significant in expanding the field of organizational theory to incorporate key examples that move away from mainstream and traditional perspectives. It will serve as a complementary text for graduate students in the fields of organization theory, management history and critical management studies.  aDescription based on print record. 0aOrganizational sociologyxHistory. 0aElectronic books.1 aPeltonen, Tuomo,eeditor.1 aGaggiotti, Hugo,eeditor.1 aCase, Peter,d1959-eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781785368745 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781785368745/9781785368745.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817853687527 a10.4337/97817853687522doi07671nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002300184245017200207264005500379300003500434336002600469337002600495338003600521490004800557500002000605505513000625520109705755588003906852650004906891650003606940655002206976700002806998710004107026776002907067793002807096856007607124856004207200024003107242eep9781785366284UtOrBLW20180723084634.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781785366284 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aTX911.5b.H36 201800aHandbook of research methods for tourism and hospitality management /cedited by Robin Nunkoo (Associate Professor, Department of Management, University of Mauritius). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (584 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aHandbooks of research methods in management  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Part I: Foundations of tourism and hospitality research -- 1.

In this Handbook, renowned experts fulfil a pressing need to outline, gather and resolve methodological issues within tourism and hospitality into one original, global and comprehensive work. With over 40 chapters by leading researchers, this Handbook allows for the exploration of new innovative ideas and presents future challenges in the field. Sharing their trusted methods and previous successes and failures, the authors cover various quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods approaches, including sampling and knowledge transfer. Sections also explore the foundations of research and wider debates in tourism and hospitality, such as ethical issues and climate change.

A greater impetus has emerged in recent years for larger corporations to assume a pivotal role in framing the issues of climate change-focused policy, ensuring environmental sustainability across the value chain and in leading by example with best implementation practices. This collection of leading-edge research addresses the fast-evolving role of multinational enterprises as agents of change in standard development and as diffusers of innovation in solving sustainability problems. CSR and Climate Change Implications for Multinational Enterprises presents a unique lens to address generic issues and how they manifest and find resolution in various industry sectors, from the perspective of different disciplines ranging from logistics to finance to ethics. Contributors from the United States, Europe and emerging economies offer contrasting views on how corporate social governance best addresses the sustainability implications of climate change, seeking innovative ways to incorporate environmental stewardship in policy design and operational firm-level concerns. This is a critical resource for both researchers and practitioners, as well as policy makers who focus on sustainability in the corporate contexts. It serves as a fresh reference for graduate level students and academics concerned with global corporate governance in the evolving context of multinationality.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSustainable development. 0aSocial responsibility of business. 0aClimatic changes. 0aElectronic books.1 aMcIntyre, John R.,eeditor.1 aIvanaj, Silvester,eeditor.1 aIvanaj, Vera,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786437754 (hardback)  aBackstage Library Works 0aNew horizons in international business.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786437754/9781786437754.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864377617 a10.4337/97817864377612doi03834nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002500184245036900209264005500578300003500633336002600668337002600694338003600720490002900756500002000785505074400805520144401549588003902993650004603032655002203078700003603100700003103136710004103167776005103208793002803259856007603287856004203363024003103405eep9781786439796UtOrBLW20180723084634.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180223s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786439796 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF5549.15b.T43 201800aTeaching human resource management :ban experiential approach /cedited by Suzanne C. de Janasz (Ph.D., Visiting Professor of Management and Conflict Analysis and Resolution, George Mason University, US), and Joanna Crossman (Associate Dean Postgraduate, International College of Management, Sydney and Adjunct Associate Professor, University of South Australia). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (336 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aElgar guides to teaching  aIncludes index.0 aContents: 1.

In this way, readers will be able to better relate theoretical concepts to workplace decisions and dilemmas. The management of human resources (HR) is a critical function contributing to an organization's competitiveness in ways that are at least as important as the management of financial and capital resources. To that end, it is essential that future managers and HR specialists destined for careers in business, government and not for profit organizations develop key skills and competences in HR. Experiential learning ignites the desire to learn, while revealing the importance and impact of knowledge and skills necessary to analyze and resolve HR-related dilemmas and challenges in contemporary organizations. While many publications provide direction and advice on the teaching of organizational behavior and leadership, it is harder to find accessible books to support the teaching of HR in motivating and grounded ways. The authors include over 65 exercises, activities, and cases for the undergraduate, MBA and executive learning classrooms. HR professors and practitioners will find it of value and students will be left feeling well prepared for the kinds of situations that await them in the field of - and situations requiring expertise in - HR.  aDescription based on print record. 0aPersonnel managementxStudy and teaching. 0aElectronic books.1 aDe Janasz, Suzanne C.,eeditor.1 aCrossman, Joanna,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786439789 (hardback)z9781786439802 (pbk.)  aBackstage Library Works40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786439789/9781786439789.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864397967 a10.4337/97817864397962doi05895nam  22004455i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245029800206264005500504300003500559336002600594337002600620338003600646490005700682500002000739504004100759505265600800520147703456650002904933650002304962650004404985650003905029650003905068655002205107700003005129700003105159700004005190710004105230776002905271856007605300856004205376024003105418eep9781788110006UtOrBLW20180821070622.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180223s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788110006 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHC79.E5bR47 201800aResearch handbook of investing in the triple bottom line :bfinance, society and the environment /cedited by Sabri Boubaker (South Champagne Business School, France), Douglas Cumming (College of Business, Florida Atlantic University, US), and Duc Khuong Nguyen (IPAG Business School, France). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (520 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aResearch handbooks in business and management series  aIncludes index.  aIncludes bibliographical references.0 aContents: Part I sustainability, financial stability and fraud -- 1.

This Research Handbook provides the most recent developments, current practices and new initiatives related to sustainable finance and impact investing. In doing so, it demonstrates how the triple bottom line principle can be used to design sustainable strategies for firms, markets and the economy as a whole. The Handbook covers aspects of socially responsible investment, finance and sustainable development, corporate socially responsible banking, green bonds and sustainable financial instruments. Comprising 20 topical chapters from experts in the field, this Handbook is a comprehensive investigation of financial services and products that help cope with sustainable investing and climate risk management. Chapters discuss the role of regulation framework in guaranteeing the stability and resilience of financial markets and offer insight into governance issues including the management of organizational risks, CSR culture, and social-impact investing culture. An essential reference for scholars and students, the multidisciplinary approach covers business, finance, accounting, management and entrepreneurship. Practitioners such as financial analysts, rating agencies and regulators will also find this an accessible read for exploring the possibilities the triple bottom line principle can provide. 0aSustainable development. 0aSocial accounting. 0aInvestmentsxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aClimatic changesxRisk management. 0aSustainable development reporting. 0aElectronic books.1 aBoubaker, Sabri,eeditor.1 aCumming, Douglas,eeditor.1 aNguyen, Duc Khuong,d1978-eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786439994 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786439994/9781786439994.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881100067 a10.4337/97817881100062doi05077nam  22004455i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245041800206264005500624300003500679336002600714337002600740338003600766490006000802500002000862504004100882505184700923520128302770650002904053650002904082650005604111650005604167655002204223700004404245700003304289700003304322710004104355776002904396830005704425856007604482856004204558024003104600eep9781788116855UtOrBLW20180821070622.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180223s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788116855 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHC79.E5bS63 201800aSocial innovation and sustainable entrepreneurship /cedited by Maritza I.

The field is progressing fastest in the measurement and measuring of social entrepreneurial effectiveness. Social innovators, who draw from philanthropy, as well as capital markets, for financial resources, have adopted the lean start up as a paradigm for their organization logics. This collection showcases the myriad emerging philosophical, methodological, and theoretical approaches, many of which are led by practitioners. It is organized into five sections. The first section reports on theoretical approaches to researching sustainable entrepreneurship that are less familiar. The second section reports on research focusing on the entrepreneurial responses to problems of climate change. The third and fourth sections report on research investigating social entrepreneurial processes, and how opportunities are formed and exploited. The fifth section reports on the ethical dimensions of social innovation. Researchers, scholars, educators and policymakers will find this book a useful reference, with novel ideas for future research and discourse. 0aSustainable development. 0aSocial entrepreneurship. 0aSustainable developmentxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aSocial entrepreneurshipxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aPhan, Phillip Hin Choi,d1963-eeditor.1 aMarkman, Gideon D.,eeditor.1 aEspina, Maritza I.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788116848 (hardback) 0aJohns Hopkins University series on entrepreneurship.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788116848/9781788116848.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881168557 a10.4337/97817881168552doi05530nam  22004335i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245058100205264005500786300003400841336002600875337002600901338003600927500002000963504004100983505208001024520145403104650005004558650002204608650004404630650002904674655002204703700003804725700003004763700002904793700005504822710004104877776002904918856007604947856004205023024003105065eep9781786432469UtOrBLW20180821070622.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180223s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781786432469 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB615b.E58 201800aEntrepreneurial universities :bcollaboration, education and policies /cedited by Jo�ao J.

The authors evaluate how universities engage with communities while also balancing stakeholder considerations, and explore how universities should be managed in the future to integrate into global society effectively. The book reflects the internationalization of entrepreneurial universities with examples from Australia, Brazil, France, Italy, Malaysia, India, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the UK. Each chapter identifies the differing cultural influences and how changes in policy approaches mean that universities are constantly evolving. The authors also look into how culture influences entrepreneurship education and, in turn, how culture affects the initiatives of policy makers. With a focus on enhancing entrepreneurial opportunities, universities are shown to respond by creating effective initiatives that benefit the wider community through successful collaboration with institutions. The book identifies the close working relationship between new government policies and developing entrepreneurial universities. Researchers, policy analysts and students of entrepreneurship education, education management and policy will find this book a useful supplementary read for understanding the future role of universities. 0aEntrepreneurshipxStudy and teaching (Higher) 0aEntrepreneurship. 0aBusiness incubatorsxGovernment policy. 0aSocial entrepreneurship. 0aElectronic books.1 aFerreira, Jo�ao J.

It lays the foundations for a methodology that bridges entrepreneurship researchers' need to provide explanations and practitioners' need to make their local world comprehensible - by calling the researcher to also practise as an entrepreneur. Disclosing Entrepreneurship as Practice outlines and demonstrates this 'enactive' approach and its outcomes in terms of a proposed practice theory of entrepreneurship. Presenting entrepreneurship as a sense-making, stabilising force in a liquid and ambiguous world, accordingly addressed as 'entrepreneuring', Bengt Johannisson argues that the duality of shrewdness and prudence provides the appropriate knowledge needed to practise entrepreneurship. By generalising entrepreneurship as creative organizing in multiple arenas beyond just the market, and conceptualising entrepreneurship as practice, this book presents a compelling rationale for considering entrepreneuring as 'routinized improvisation' dealing with situations as they arise. Reflective and thoughtful, this book will be of interest to researchers in the field of entrepreneurship concerned with theoretical and methodological matters, as well as those engaged with qualitative methodology in the social sciences. 0aEntrepreneurshipxResearch. 0aEntrepreneurshipxMethodology. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781785361364 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781785361364/9781785361364.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817853613717 a10.4337/97817853613712doi06034nam  22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003300144042000800177050002200185245060000207264005500807300003400862336002600896337002600922338003600948500002000984504004101004505287001045520124403915650002405159650004205183650002605225650002405251655002205275700002805297700003505325700003305360710004105393776002905434856007605463856004205539024003105581eep9781783476084UtOrBLW20180821070622.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180223s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781783476084 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLC dUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHM821 b.H36 201800aHandbook of research methods in diversity management, equality and inclusion at work /cedited by Lize A.E.

While current research approaches frequently fall short of addressing the challenges faced in EDI research, this benchmark Handbook brings coverage of research methods in EDI up to date, and advances the development of research in the field. Bringing together well-known academics and researchers, this Handbook is a distillation of current and novel research in the field of EDI. Chapters present groundbreaking new research and methodological perspectives on international, regional and national issues, from equal opportunities and gender mainstreaming to managing diversity in legal, political and socio-economic contexts. Alongside this, the authors discuss new analytic directions to advance empirical EDI research. This Handbook will help to shape the present and future EDI discourse. The book is an invaluable addition to the current literature, particularly for students of EDI and researchers working in the fields of human resource management, strategic management and organization, and culture and change management as well as entrepreneurship and marketing. 0aEqualityxResearch. 0aDiversity in the workplacexResearch. 0aGender mainstreaming. 0aSocial integration. 0aElectronic books.1 aBooysen, Lize,eeditor.1 aBendl, Regine,d1963-eeditor.1 aPringle, Judith K.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781783476077 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781783476077/9781783476077.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817834760847 a10.4337/97817834760842doi04690nam  22004695i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245023600206264005500442300003500497336002600532337002600558338003600584490005700620500002000677504004100697505191100738520107302649650002803722650002403750650002503774650002403799650002303823650003003846650001303876650002803889655002203917700003103939700003103970710004104001776002904042856007604071856004204147024003104189eep9781786430281UtOrBLW20180821070622.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180402s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781786430281 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF5429b.H36 201800aHandbook of research on retailing /cedited by Katrijn Gielens (Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina, US) and Els Gijsbrechts (Tilburg School of Economics and Management, Tilburg University, the Netherlands). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (480 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aResearch handbooks in business and management series  aIncludes index.  aIncludes bibliographical references.0 aContents: Introduction -- Part I: The changing retailscape -- 1.

Boundaries are blurring: traditional brick-and-mortar players are expanding their online operations and setting up their own discount banners, while the power houses of online retail are going physical, and hard discounters get caught up in the Wheel of Retailing. Each of these players has to keep up with the consumer - even successful companies cannot sit back and rest but need to prepare for the next wave of change. This Handbook sheds light on these issues with its research-based analysis of the strategic and tactical issues that comprise the state of the art in retailing. Leading scholars explore what we know from extant studies, what are the ensuing best practices, what evolutions are ahead, and whether current approaches still work in the future. This book's future-based perspective makes it an excellent resource for academics in retailing and marketing, as well as marketing and retailing consultants, retailers, and marketing managers. 0aRetail tradexResearch. 0aMarketing research. 0aElectronic commerce. 0aConsumer profiling. 0aConsumer behavior. 0aRetail tradexManagement. 0aPricing. 0aDispaly of merchandise. 0aElectronic books.1 aGielens, Katrijn,eeditor.1 aGijsbrechts, Els,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786430274 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786430274/9781786430274.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864302817 a10.4337/97817864302812doi04062nam  22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002100196245032000217264005500537300003500592336002600627337002600653338003600679490004300715500002000758505137800778520109302156588003903249650003003288655002203318700002603340700003903366700002803405710004103433776002903474856007603503856004203579024003103621eep9781788972307UtOrBLW20180912094616.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180509s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788972307 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  ae------ 4aHB615b.E58 201800aEntrepreneurship, innovation and education :bfrontiers in European entrepreneurship research /cedited by Ulla Hytti (Research Director, University of Turku, Finland), Robert Blackburn (Professor, Kingston University, UK), and Eddy Laveren (Professor, University of Antwerp and Antwerp Management School, Belgium). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (224 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aFrontiers in European entrepreneurship  aIncludes index.0 aContents: 1.

This book critically discusses innovation and entrepreneurship in new and varied contexts in Europe. Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Education explores the need for researching innovation and learning in family firms, micro firms, SMEs and in rural and network contexts. The chapters offer new insights into the antecedents of business performance in SMEs by investigating social capital and marketing capabilities. The book includes a new typology for analysing entrepreneurship education programmes, discusses opportunities for embedding entrepreneurship in teacher education and explores entrepreneurship in the informal learning arenas in universities. This book includes a wide range of studies from different analytical and methodological perspectives and from various regional and industrial contexts. As such, it is a valuable tool for advanced students of European entrepreneurship. Researchers in entrepreneurship will also benefit from the up-to-date research analysis in this book.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEntrepreneurshipzEurope. 0aElectronic books.1 aHytti, Ulla,eeditor.1 aBlackburn, Robert,d1952-eeditor.1 aLaveren, Eddy,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788972291 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788972291/9781788972291.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889723077 a10.4337/97817889723072doi03498nam  22003615i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002400184100003700208245015800245264005500403300003400458336002600492337002600518338003600544500002000580505070800600520151801308588003902826650003702865655002202902710004102924776002902965856006902994856004203063024003103105eep9781788114141UtOrBLW20180912094616.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180509s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788114141 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD30.255b.J66 20181 aJones, Geoffrey,d1952-eauthor.10aVarieties of green business :bindustries, nations and time /cGeoffrey Jones (Isidor Straus Professor of Business History, Harvard Business School, US). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (288 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Preface -- 1.

This book provides rich new empirical evidence on green business as it examines its variation between industries and nations, and over time. It demonstrates the deep historical origins of endeavors to create for-profit businesses that were more responsible and sustainable, but also how these strategies have faced constraints, trade-offs and challenges of legitimacy. Based on extensive interviews and archives from around the world, the book asks why green business succeeds more in some contexts than others and draws lessons from failure as well as success. This book emphasizes the importance of context for explaining the choices which explain the varieties of green business. Government policies, both local and national, cultural and religious values, and national images, are amongst the contextual factors which are identified. The book's distinctiveness lies in the use of original empirical data and the fact that it considers both successful and unsuccessful cases. An unusually wide geographical scope means that it covers not only the United States and Europe, but also less studied settings, including Chile, Costa Rica, New Zealand and Japan. Scholars and students interested in environmental management, corporate social responsibility, business ethics and trust, and business and environmental history will find this an important and fascinating read.  aDescription based on print record. 0aBusinessxEnvironmental aspects. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788114134 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788114134/9781788114134.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881141417 a10.4337/97817881141412doi04859nam  22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245030800205264005500513300003500568336002600603337002600629338003600655490004300691500002000734505166700754520159202421588003904013650001604052650002604068655002204094700003104116700003904147710004104186776002904227830004404256856007604300856004204376024003104418eep9781786430892UtOrBLW20181011075147.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180516s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786430892 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB501b.C66 201800aComparative capitalism and the transitional periphery :bfirm centred perspectives /cedited by Mehmet Demirbag (Professor of International Business and Deputy Dean, Essex Business School), and Geoffrey Wood (Dean and Professor of International Business, Essex Business School, University of Essex, UK). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (288 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aNew horizons in international business  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Introduction / Geoffrey Wood and Mehmet Demirbag -- Part 1 -- Transitional periphery - Central Asia -- 1.

Chapters shed light on their distinct forms of capitalism, and how it influences and adapts the firms located there. The eminent authors show how, in a post-state socialist world, there are several implications for both domestic and overseas firms functioning successfully in the transitional periphery. With the complex mix of political and market mediation and informal personal ties, chapters explore the delicate balance of liberalisation in transitional economies. Detailed examples from specific countries in Eurasia and Central Asia such as Belarus, Azerbaijan, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Armenia and Georgia are discussed alongside broader thematic issues of economic and social change, labour relations and human resource management. Most importantly, it is shown that liberalisation has little connection to short-term business growth. To succeed in such contexts, international firms need to be both pragmatic and creative in coping with malleable yet durable forms of institutional mediation. Providing a unique perspective on the transitional economic periphery and much-needed insights from international business, this book is essential reading for researchers and graduate students studying transitional economies, non-traditional business models, institutional persistence and change, political and economic development and management in economically transitioning countries.  aDescription based on print record. 0aCapitalism. 0aBusiness enterprises. 0aElectronic books.1 aDemirbag, Mehmet,eeditor.1 aWood, Geoffrey E.,d1945-eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786430885 (hardback) 0aNew horizons in international business.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786430885/9781786430885.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864308927 a10.4337/97817864308922doi03954nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245034500206264005500551300003400606336002600640337002600666338003600692500002000728505117700748520122501925588003903150650002203189650001403211655002203225700003003247700002903277700003103306710004103337776002903378856007603407856004203483024003103525eep9781786434883UtOrBLW20181011075147.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180516s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786434883 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD7261b.S63 201800aSocial functions of emotion and talking about emotion at work /cedited by Dirk Lindebaum (Cardiff Business School, Cardiff University, UK), Deanna Geddes (Professor in HRM, Fox School of Business, Temple University, US), and Peter J.

Drawing on psychological and sociological research, this book provides groundbreaking insights for understanding how emotions are used in the workplace. Bringing together contributions from leading emotion researchers, this book features chapters focusing on 10 emotions, ranging from awe to shame. Through its exploration of the ways each emotion functions in relation to how we talk about them, this book injects fresh theoretical and practical momentum into how our discussions of workplace emotion can affect how emotional events are appraised over time and place. This, in turn influences the causes, expressions, and consequences of emotions in the workplace. With its novel approach, this book will be an invaluable tool for academics researching emotion, as well as postgraduate students working in the social sciences seeking reference material on emotion. HR managers and general readers seeking greater insight into emotions at work will also find this book to be a useful tool.  aDescription based on print record. 0aWork environment. 0aEmotions. 0aElectronic books.1 aLindebaum, Dirk,eeditor.1 aGeddes, Deanna,eeditor.1 aJordan, Peter J.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786434876 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786434876/9781786434876.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864348837 a10.4337/97817864348832doi04564nam  22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245026700206264004900473300003400522336002600556337002600582338003600608500002000644505172700664520138902391588003903780650005803819655002203877700004103899700003103940710004103971776002904012856007604041856004204117024003104159eep9781786437020UtOrBLW20181011075147.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180808s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786437020 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aLB2805b.A38 201800aAdvancing doctoral leadership education through technology /cedited by Laura Hyatt (Professor, Department of Organizational Leadership, University of La Verne), and Stuart Allen (Professor, Department of Organizational Leadership, Robert Morris University, US). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2018.  a1 online resource (264 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Foreword by Ronald E.

Advancing Doctoral Leadership Education Through Technology addresses the growing need for universities to explore, revise, and develop the content and delivery of doctoral leadership education. A growing number of programs and the more recent inclusion of leadership courses within varied postgraduate disciplines illustrates the rising interest in doctoral leadership education. Advances in technology provide a vehicle to deliver content and information to a wide array of learners, therefore it is time to ask questions about the benefits, challenges and needed solutions to prepare for the future design and delivery of leadership education. This book offers valuable information for faculty and administrators responsible for developing and delivering doctoral studies through technology in order to provide access, convenience, enriched learning, and to create new pathways to achieve a doctorate. Professors working in a classroom-based, or primarily in virtual environments, or in a hybrid of both could also benefit from reading this book. Doctoral students engaged in completing their dissertations and research projects will also find a wealth of information related to higher education teaching, learning, and technology.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEducational leadershipxStudy and teaching (Graduate) 0aElectronic books.1 aHyatt, Laura,dactive 2018,eeditor.1 aAllen, Stuart A.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786437013 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786437013/9781786437013.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864370207 a10.4337/97817864370202doi03375nam  22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184100003300206245034900239264005500588300003400643336002600677337002600703338003600729500002000765505046300785520140001248588003902648650001502687650002202702655002202724700003102746710004102777776002902818856006902847856004202916024003102958eep9781788111324UtOrBLW20181011075147.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180516s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788111324 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF5415b.H57 20181 aHisrich, Robert D.,eauthor.10aEntrepreneurial marketing :ba practical managerial approach /cRobert D.

This book discusses governance theory in relation to corporations, universities and markets. Confronting the challenges of governing these three core areas, Alexander Styhre explores the connections between governance and the production of economic value, shareholder value and economic equality. An in-depth overview of recent governance literature in management studies, economics, legal theory and economic sociology exposes how governance theory affects securities markets, commodities trade, university ranking and credit scoring cases. The author examines how changes in competitive capitalism and the wider social organization of society are recursively both determined by, and actively shaping, the underlying governance ideals and practices. Identifying the difficulties involved in balancing freedom and control in governance policy, he highlights the key concerns confronting governments, regulatory agencies and transnational agencies: how to ensure the efficient use of economic resources to avoid economic inequality without undermining the legitimacy of the current market-based economic model. Essential reading for academics and graduates in management and the social sciences, as well as policy makers and management consultants, The Unfinished Business of Governance gives exceptional insight into the challenges facing governance within free markets.  aDescription based on print record. 0aCorporate governance. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788113137 (hardback) 0aNew perspectives on the modern corporation.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788113137/9781788113137.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881131447 a10.4337/97817881131442doi02944nam  22003615i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184100005600205245014000261264005500401300003400456336002600490337002600516338003600542504005100578505046100629520119701090588003902287650002202326655002202348710004102370776002902411856006902440856004202509024003102551eep9781788118354UtOrBLW20181011075148.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180516s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788118354 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB615b.R49 20181 aReynolds, Paul D.q(Paul Davidson),d1938-eauthor.10aBusiness creation :bten factors for entrepreneurial success /cPaul D.

In this insightful book, Paul D. Reynolds presents an overview of the major factors associated with contemporary business creation, reflecting representative samples of U.S. early stage nascent ventures, and emphasizing the unique features of the two-fifths that achieve profitability. This in-depth assessment includes empirical descriptions of a broad range of relevant features of the entrepreneurial process. By using representative samples of nascent entrepreneurs and ventures in the U.S., it allows extrapolation to U.S. populations of entrepreneurs, pre-profit ventures, and activity in all economic sectors. Outcomes including profitability and disengagement are identified in multiple follow-up interviews. A useful resource for scholars concerned with business creation, this book also makes an engaging supplementary course book for upper division and graduate courses in business plan creation and research methods. Policy analysts emphasizing programs and policies to enhance business creation will also find it enlightening.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEntrepreneurship. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788118347 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788118347/9781788118347.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881183547 a10.4337/97817881183542doi02793nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184100003300205245028900238264005500527300003400582336002600616337002600642338003600668500002000704505063100724520067301355588003902028650002202067650001002089655002202099700003202121700003002153710004102183776002902224856006902253856004202322024003102364eep9781788111546UtOrBLW20181107092626.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180523s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788111546 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB615b.M67 20181 aMorris, Michael H.,eauthor.10aPoverty and entrepreneurship in developed economies /cMichael H.

With innovation research moving away from the traditional focus on manufacturing towards services, this book develops a much-needed integrated approach for improving analysis of both experience and service innovation. This impressive book makes a substantial and compelling contribution to research on the interdependencies between innovation, services and experiences. Split into clear and thematically separate categories, the contributors explore systemic innovation, practice-based innovation, technology and innovation, and experiences as a catalyst for innovation. Examples are taken from the tourism industry, entrepreneurial ventures, online gaming and digital services, to provide readers with a thorough overview of the extensive impact of these innovations. Using organizational, systemic, conceptual and empirical examinations of the experience and service economies, the authors identify how top class innovation research can be extended and integrated further with other research areas. Presenting a state-of-the-art analysis of the topic, this timely book will benefit teachers of innovation, the experience economy, and information systems. Researchers of business economics, and marketing will also find this an essential foundation volume for future research on topics of innovation in a globalizing world.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomics. 0aElectronic books.1 aScupola, Ada,eeditor.1 aFuglsang, Lars,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788114295 (hardback) 0aServices, economy, and innovation.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788114295/9781788114295.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881143017 a10.4337/97817881143012doi03802nam  22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184100003200206245045500238264004900693300003500742336002600777337002600803338003600829490006200865500002000927505035300947520161901300588003902919650003102958655002202989700002903011700003503040700003003075710004103105776002903146830006303175856006903238856004203307024003103349eep9781786437044UtOrBLW20181211091636.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180808s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng d  a9781786437044 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD58.9b.G58 20181 aGiustiniano, Luca,eauthor.10aElgar introduction to theories of organizational resilience /cLuca Giustiniano (Department of Business and Management, LUISS Guido Carli University, Italy), Stewart R.

Future trajectories for research on resilience -- Index.  aWith organizational environments becoming more unstable, uncertain and equivocal, the concept of resilience has become increasingly significant for management studies and practice. Resilience connotes organizational, team and individual capacities to absorb external shocks and to learn from them, while simultaneously preparing for and responding to external jolts. This book pinpoints the essential aspects of managerial and organizational resilience and offers insights that stimulate critical thinking. As the concept of resilience is essentially made up of contrasting forces, the volume presents some innovative synthetic interpretation that allows a deeper comprehension of the phenomenon and provides managers and policy-makers with a solid basis for taking their decisions. This book provides an accessible yet rigorous systematization of individual resilience, team resilience and organizational resilience. Rich with real-life concept illustrations and containing practice-oriented tools, reflection questions and exercises, it shows how resilience can be cultivated across levels of organizational aggregation: individuals, teams, organizations and communities. The authors distinguish individual and collective resilience from related constructs and shed light on the boundaries of resilience and its potential implications for management practice. Elgar Introduction to Theories of Organizational Resilience will serve as a key resource for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students as well as academics and practitioners who are interested in deepening their understanding of resilience.  aDescription based on print record. 0aOrganizational resilience. 0aElectronic books.1 aClegg, Stewart,eauthor.1 aCunha, Miguel Pina e,eauthor.1 aRego, Arménio,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786437037 (hardback) 0aElgar introductions to management and organization theory.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786437037/9781786437037.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864370447 a10.4337/97817864370442doi06989nam  22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002100196245033000217264004900547300003500596336002600631337002600657338003600683490004100719500002000760505395900780520140504739588003906144650002206183650005706205655002206262700004806284700002806332710004106360776002906401856007606430856004206506024003106548eep9781788114950UtOrBLW20181211091637.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180808s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng d  a9781788114950 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  an-us--- 4aHB615b.A56 201800aAnnals of entrepreneurship education and pedagogy 2018 /cedited by Charles H.

Building a better business case: Where do we go from here? -- Index.  aIn business, does it pay to be good? Drawing from two decades of published conceptual and empirical scholarship, this book outlines the mechanisms of the business case for corporate social responsibility and demonstrates the conditions that cause good corporate acts to succeed, or fail, in turning a profit. Central to the explanation is the role of stakeholders, who are portrayed as agents who can turn corporate "good into gold" but lack the capacity to do so consistently. This book takes a critical perspective, noting significant limits on the ability of stakeholders to reward good corporate behavior and rein in bad corporate acts. It concludes with several ways that scholars can improve this important and popular research topic. Using arguments built from two decades of highly cited and award-winning published scholarship, Michael L. Barnett uses strong theoretical building blocks and a well-vetted critical perspective to chart the boundaries of the business case for corporate social responsibility. The original introduction organizes and integrates this world-class research into a coherent and convincing story, while the original concluding chapter takes the reader beyond the current literature and provides a path forward that can build a better business case. A multifaceted mix of conceptual and empirical work across levels of analysis (individual, firm, and industry) provides a comprehensive perspective, warts and all. This critical and approachable collection will be a key resource for management scholars, from doctoral students to senior professors, whether they seek to gain a foothold on the core topic of the relationship between business and society or wish to find a way to add to this rich literature. The book would fit as a resource in doctoral seminars and university libraries. Consulting firms and practitioners may also take interest, as they prepare for, and prepare others for, leadership roles in corporations.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSocial responsibility of business. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788970686 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788970686.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889706937 a10.4337/97817889706932doi04367nam  22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184100003300205245023900238264005500477300003400532336002600566337002600592338003600618504005100654505140700705520153802112588003903650650002803689650001603717655002203733700002803755710004103783776002903824856005503853856004203908024003103950eep9781786435903UtOrBLW20180115070621.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170628s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781786435903 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB131b.C65 20181 aColander, David C.,eauthor.10aHow economics should be done :bessays on the art and craft of economics /cDavid C.

His pragmatic approach sees applied policy methodology as rooted in what economists actually do, not in what methodologists say they should do. It sees applied policy methodology as constantly evolving as analytic and computational technology changes, evolving far too fast to be subject to any rigid scientific methodology. That problem is that economists generally think of applied policy analysis as applied science. Colander argues that using a scientific methodology to guide applied policy undermines good policy analysis. Instead, he contends that economists should use a much looser engineering methodology that blends science, heuristics, inescapable moral judgments, and creativity into what he calls the art and craft of economics. Here, Huei-chun Su has selected seventeen of Colander's articles that spell out and capture his arguments at various levels - some formal academic articles dealing with cutting edge methodology, and some more popular articles making the case for his approach. An original introduction and annotated bibliography serve as excellent resources for further exploring his arguments. Clear, well-structured, and written in plain English with little jargon, the book is approachable and suitable for anyone interested in the current and future state of economics and the economics profession. This includes students at any level as well as methodologists, applied economists, historians and critics of modern economics.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomicsxMethodology. 0aEconomists. 0aElectronic books.1 aSu, Huei-chun,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786435897 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786435897.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864359037 a10.4337/97817864359032doi04605nam  22004335i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002100196245048100217264005500698300003500753336002600788337002600814338003600840490003800876500002000914505133500934520145702269588003903726651003203765650001403797655002203811700002803833700003803861700003503899710004103934776002903975830003904004856005504043856004204098024003104140eep9781788110440UtOrBLW20180115070622.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170726s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788110440 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  aa-ja--- 4aHC462b.E26 201800aEconomic stagnation in Japan :bexploring the causes and remedies of Japanization /cedited by Dongchul Cho (Member of the Monetary Policy Board, The Bank of Korea and former Chief Economist, Korea Development Institute), Takatoshi Ito (Professor in the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, US), and Andrew Mason (Professor of Economics, University of Hawaii at Manoa and Senior Fellow, Population and Health Studies, East-West Center, Hawaii, US). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2018.  a1 online resource (352 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aKDI/EWC series on economic policy  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Preface -- 1.

The term 'Japanization' is often used by economists to describe long-term stagnation and deflation. Symptoms include high unemployment, weak economic activity, interest rates near zero, quantitative easing, and population aging. In the global context, what can governments do to mitigate the downward trends experienced by Japan? This judiciously timed book investigates in depth the causes of Japan's 'lost decades' versus the real recovery achieved by the United States, and the lessons that can be learned. This book helps to provide a basis for assessing a wide range of policy approaches from which policymakers and governments can choose to avoid economic decline. The expert contributions provide an overview of the pattern of 'Japanization' in a global economic perspective, analyze similarities and differences between the Korean and Japanese economies, and examine policy measures taken by Japan during the lost decades. From this analysis, the book proposes future policy solutions for countries experiencing 'Japanization'. Economic stagnation and the relevant policy reactions have been of keen interest around the globe since the global financial crisis and this book will be an invaluable resource for scholars, policymakers, and economic commentators alike.  aDescription based on print record. 0aJapanxEconomic conditions. 0aJaponism. 0aElectronic books.1 aCho, Dongchul,eeditor.1 aItō, Takatoshi,d1944-eeditor.1 aMason, Andrew,d1947-eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788110433 (hardback) 0aKDI/EWC series on economic policy.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788110433.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881104407 a10.4337/97817881104402doi05352nam  22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245020800206264005500414300003400469336002600503337002600529338003600555500002000591505265500611520131303266588003904579650002504618650002004643655002204663700003204685700005104717710004104768776002904809856005504838856004204893024003104935eep9781785366154UtOrBLW20180115070621.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170726s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781785366154 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF1379b.H36 201800aHandbook of international trade and transportation /cedited by Bruce A.

But while the connection between transport and trade flows is clear, the academic literature often looks at these two issues separately. This Handbook is unique in pulling together the key insights of each field while highlighting what we know about their intersection and ideas for future research in this relatively unexamined but growing area of study. After presenting the latest data and modeling techniques used to explain global trade patterns, the chapters address directly the core theme of the Handbook: the intersection of international trade and transportation costs. Other key topics examined include trade facilitation, trade networks, and the role of transport costs in offshoring, foreign investment location, and the role of intermediary firms. The Handbook is an excellent primer on the essential concepts and references in international trade and transport for scholars who may have their primary expertise in one of these areas, but are not as familiar with the other. It will also be an invaluable resource for advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, and other researchers who are relatively new to either field.  aDescription based on print record. 0aInternational trade. 0aTransportation. 0aElectronic books.1 aWilson, Wesley W.,eeditor.1 aBlonigen, Bruce A.q(Bruce Aloysius),eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781785366147 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781785366147.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817853661547 a10.4337/97817853661542doi02901nam  22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184100003900204245015400243264005500397300003500452336002600487337002600513338003600539490004300575504005100618505047700669520101801146588003902164650003402203655002202237710004102259776002902300830004402329856006902373856004202442024003102484eep9781784718213UtOrBLW20180115070621.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170726s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781784718213 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB73b.S74 20181 aStephen, Frank H.,d1946-eauthor.10aLaw and development :ban institutional critique /cFrank H.

It has been argued that without legal systems that allow for innovation and enterprise, all other attempts to improve economic growth are destined to fail. Law and Development offers an unparalleled assessment of the role of legal systems in development by extending the analytical framework of New Institutional Economics (NIE). Using empirical tests to critique Legal Origin Theory, and assess the role of culture in the formation of the legal environment, this book proposes that cultural factors are much more significant than allowed for by previous frameworks. This book will be invaluable for students of law and development, as well as academics researching the role of institutions. It provides a sound framework for considering legal reform and offers nuanced insights for policymakers interested in economic development.  aDescription based on print record. 0aLaw and economic development. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781784718206 (hardback) 0aAdvances in new institutional analysis.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781784718206/9781784718206.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817847182137 a10.4337/97817847182132doi04997nam  22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245056000206264006300766300003500829336002600864337002600890338003600916490003700952500002000989505188101009520128102890588003904171650001904210655002204229700003904251700003404290700002704324710004104351776002904392830003804421856005504459856004204514024003104556eep9781786432483UtOrBLW20180227130636.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170726s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786432483 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF1365b.G56 201800aGlobalization, international spillovers and sectoral changes :bimplications for regions and industries /cedited by Charlie Karlsson (Professor Emeritus of the Economics of Technological Change, Jönköping International Business School, Jönköping University and Professor Emeritus of Industrial Economics, Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden), Andreas P.

So too, however, are economic and financial crises. Combining a variety of methods, concepts and interdisciplinary approaches, this book provides an in-depth examination of these structural changes and their impact. Case studies from a range of countries including Japan, Turkey, Sweden, Germany and the USA offer insight into different national contexts and are used to explore a variety of theoretical and empirical issues relating to the geography of growth. Assessing the implications of globalization for businesses and sectors, the chapters focus on the interdependencies between different economic and political layers, and explore topics such as human capital, creativity, innovation, networks and collaboration. Researchers and policy-makers who are interested in regional growth at different spatial scales will find that this work addresses a number of existing knowledge gaps. Students of economics, economic geography, regional science and international industrial management will also find it to be a valuable interdisciplinary resource to help deepen their knowledge of the myriad processes induced by globalization.  aDescription based on print record. 0aGlobalization. 0aElectronic books.1 aKarlsson, Charlie,d1945-eeditor.1 aCornett, Andreas P.,eeditor.1 aWallin, Tina,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786432476 (hardback) 0aNew horizons in regional science.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786432476.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864324837 a10.4337/97817864324832doi03826nam  22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002200196100003400218245013600252264006300388300003400451336002600485337002600511338003600537504005100573505102800624520146101652588003903113651006603152655002203218710004103240776002903281856006903310856004203379024003103421eep9781786435286UtOrBLW20180227130636.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170823s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781786435286 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  an-us--- 4aJV6483b.W45 20181 aWhite, Roger,d1967-eauthor.10aImmigration policy and the shaping of US culture :bbecoming America /cRoger White (Professor of Economics, Whittier College, US). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Publishing Limited,c2018.  a1 online resource (224 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: 1.

The entirety of U.S. immigration history (1607-present) is reviewed through a recounting of related legislative acts and by examining data on immigrant inflows and cross-societal cultural distances. Prior to the Immigration Act of 1965, U.S. policy favored immigration from Europe, particularly Northern and Western Europe. Thus, American culture became similar to the cultures of European societies and of Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Changes in U.S. immigration policy during the past half century have resulted in American culture becoming more similar to the cultures of more recent arrivals' source countries (i.e., societies in Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa). Tests for structural breaks in the immigrant inflow series and descriptive analysis of the cultural differences between the U.S. and several cohorts of countries reveal fascinating details about this transformation. Population projections for the years 2015-2065 suggest continued cultural change. Corresponding policy implications are discussed. This book is a key resource for faculty, researchers and students along with policymakers, non-academics interested in immigration policy and its history, and readers interested in migration studies, global studies, and cultural studies.   aDescription based on print record. 0aUnited StatesxEmigration and immigrationxGovernment policy. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786435279 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786435279/9781786435279.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864352867 a10.4337/97817864352862doi04251nam  22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245028900205264006300494300003400557336002600591337002600617338003600643500002000679505155800699520122202257588003903479650001703518650004603535655002203581700003303603700003103636710004103667776002903708856005503737856004203792024003103834eep9781788112789UtOrBLW20180227130637.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170811s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788112789 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB144b.H36 201800aHandbook of game theory and industrial organization.nVolume II,pApplications /cedited by Luis C.

This approach has also enabled the emergence of new areas of enquiry including law and economics, networks, the digital economy, auctions, experimental game theory and many others. This second volume of the Handbook includes original contributions by experts in the field. It provides up-to-date surveys of the most relevant applications of game theory to industrial organization. The book covers both classical and industrial organization topics such as mergers in markets with homogeneous and differentiated goods, leniency and coordinated effects in cartels and mergers, static and dynamic contests, consumer search and product safety, strategic delegation, platforms and network effects, auctions, environmental and resource economics, intellectual property, healthcare, corruption, experimental industrial organization, and empirical models of research and development. Authoritative and engaging, this unique Handbook will be an indispensable resource for all serious academics, researchers and students of industrial economics and game theory.   aDescription based on print record. 0aGame theory. 0aIndustrial organization (Economic theory) 0aElectronic books.1 aCorchón, Luis C.,eeditor.1 aMarini, Marco A.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788112772 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788112772.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881127897 a10.4337/97817881127892doi01957nam  22003371u 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144050002000176110006500196245013000261264006200391300003400453336002600487337002600513338003600539490005200575520068200627650004001309650005001349655002201399710004101421776002901462856005501491856004201546024003101588eep9781788116596UtOrBLW20180227130637.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180222s2018    enk     o     000 0 eng d  a9781788116596 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW 4aHC10b.U55 20182 aUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization,eauthor.10aInternational yearbook of industrial statistics 2018 /cUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization (Vienna, Austria). 1aCheltenham, UK :bEdward Elgar Publishing Limited,c2018.  a1 online resource (704 page).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aInternational yearbook of industrial statistics  aA unique and comprehensive source of information, this book is the only international publication providing economists, planners, policymakers and business people with worldwide statistics on current performance and trends in the manufacturing sector.

It uses the tools of modern economics, game theory and structural econometrics to analyze the roles of foreign aid, educational capital, and military intervention. Jean-Paul Azam and Véronique Thelen analyze panel data over 25 years across 124 countries. They prove that foreign aid plays a key role in inducing recipient governments to protect the donors' political and economic interests within their sphere of influence. Demonstrating that countries endowed with better educational capital export fewer terrorist attacks, they also illustrate that, in contrast, military intervention is counter-productive in abating terrorism. Recognizing the strides taken by the Obama administration to increase the role of foreign aid and reduce the use of military interventions, this book shows the significant impact this has had in reducing the number of transnational terrorist attacks per source country, and suggests further developments in this vein. Practical and timely, this book will be of particular interest to students and scholars of economics and political science, as well as those working on the wider issue of terrorism. Presenting a series of new findings, the book will also appeal to international policy makers and government officials.  aDescription based on print record. 0aTerrorismxEconomic aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aThelen, Véronique,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786432162 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786432162/9781786432162.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864321797 a10.4337/97817864321792doi02772nam  22003615i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184100003400205245011300239264006300352300003400415336002600449337002600475338003600501504005100537505026700588520125300855588003902108650002902147655002202176710004102198776002902239856006902268856004202337024003102379eep9781784710026UtOrBLW20180227130635.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170823s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781784710026 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHG101b.S94 20181 aSvetlova, Ekaterina,eauthor.10aFinancial models and society :bvillains or scapegoats? /cEkaterina Svetlova (University of Leicester, UK). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Publishing Limited,c2018.  a1 online resource (192 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: 1.

Conclusions and discussion -- References -- Index.  aThis innovative book employs the social studies of finance approach, which aims to enhance the dialogue between finance and sociology by addressing the blind spots of economic and financial theories. In so doing, it challenges the accusations made towards financial models in the aftermath of the last economic crisis and argues that they cannot be condemned indiscriminately. Their influence on markets and society is not straightforward, but determined by the many ways in which models are created and then used. Ekaterina Svetlova analyses the various patterns of the application of models in asset management, risk management and financial engineering to demonstrate that their power is far more fragile than widespread criticism would indicate. This unique and stimulating book furthers our understanding of the influence of financial models on markets and society more broadly. It will be of value to academics in the social studies of finance, economic sociology, philosophy of economics and political economy.

Beginning with Thomas Malthus-whose dire predictions of mass starvation due to population growth influenced Charles Darwin-economists have routinely used biological arguments in their models and methods. The review summarizes the most important of these developments in areas such as sociobiology, evolutionary psychology, behavioral ecology, behavioral economics and finance, neuroeconomics, and behavioral genomics. This research review will be an indispensable tool for economists, biologists, and practitioners looking to develop a deeper understanding of the limits of Homo economicus. 0aBiology, Economic. 0aElectronic books.1 aLo, Andrew W.q(Andrew Wen-Chuan),eeditor.1 aZhang, Ruixin,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics ;v340.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781782548539/9781782548539.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817853683187 a10.4337/97817853683182doi03136nam  22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184100003800206245027800244264006300522300003400585336002600619337002600645338003600671504005100707505024900758520143001007588003902437650002402476655002202500700002802522710004102550776002902591856006902620856004202689024003102731eep9781786430373UtOrBLW20180227130636.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170726s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781786430373 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD38.5b.R56 20181 aRimmer, Peter J.,d1935-eauthor.10aConsumer logistics :bsurfing the digital wave /cPeter J.

This book offers a stimulating exploration of how digitization has begun transforming the prevailing global logistics system into a self-service and sharing economy, and ultimately provides a vision of the monumental changes likely to overflow into the business landscape. Consumer Logistics thoughtfully assesses the challenges posed to businesses as the Internet of Things, 3D printing and other yet-to-come technologies start to connect humans and physical objects in forms that will further transform lifestyles. Through a review of the evolutionary journey of logistics management, this book argues that the fourth wave of global logistics is fast giving way to the fifth wave of consumer logistics, which will see consumers adapt to the seamless offline-online purchasing experience brought by Omnichannel Retailing. By considering how logistics and digital technologies will interact to redefine consumer logistics, Peter J. Rimmer and Booi Hon Kam argue that this outcome is likely to reflect the character of the sixth great logistics wave: personal logistics. Thought-provoking, and contemporary in topic, this book will be of great value to business people interested in future trends, logistics professionals and operators, as well as academics and students worldwide working on logistics, supply chains and digital transformations.  aDescription based on print record. 0aBusiness logistics. 0aElectronic books.1 aHon Kam, Booi,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786430366 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786430366/9781786430366.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864303737 a10.4337/97817864303732doi04137nam  22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245028200205264006300487300003400550336002600584337002600610338003600636500002000672505149600692520117702188588003903365650001703404650004603421655002203467700003303489700003103522710004103553776002903594856005503623856004203678024003103720eep9781785363283UtOrBLW20180227130636.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170726s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781785363283 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB144b.H36 201800aHandbook of game theory and industrial organization.nVolume I,pTheory /cedited by Luis C.

Game theory explores situations in which agents interact strategically and provides a useful foundation for studying many traditional industrial organization topics. The first volume of this wide-ranging Handbook contains original contributions by world-class specialists. It provides up-to-date surveys of the main tools of game theory that are used to model industrial organization topics. The Handbook covers numerous subjects in detail including, among others, the tools of lattice programming, supermodular and aggregative games, monopolistic competition, horizontal and vertically differentiated good models, dynamic and Stackelberg games, entry games, evolutionary games with adaptive players, asymmetric information, moral hazard, and learning and information sharing models. Technical yet accessible, this comprehensive resource will be required reading for both established researchers as well as graduate or advanced undergraduate students in industrial economics and game theory.  aDescription based on print record. 0aGame theory. 0aIndustrial organization (Economic theory) 0aElectronic books.1 aCorchón, Luis C.,eeditor.1 aMarini, Marco A.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781785363276 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781785363276.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817853632837 a10.4337/97817853632832doi03067nam  22003615i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002800184100002800212245021100240264004400451300003400495336002600529337002600555338003600581500002000617505051600637520124101153588003902394650003802433655002202471710004102493776002902534856006902563856004202632024003102674eep9781788111829UtOrBLW20180320080630.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||171101s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788111829 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD9502.5.C542bS53 20181 aSica, Edgardo,eauthor.10aFirms, finance, and sustainable transitions :bthe financial constraints of eco-innovation companies /cEdgardo Sica (Assistant Professor of Economics, Department of Economics, University of Foggia, Italy). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar,c2018.  a1 online resource (176 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Preface -- 1.

Financial constraints and radical eco-innovations: the case of the anaerobic digestion and biogas niche -- Conclusions -- Index.  aThis thought-provoking book introduces a financial economics perspective to the topic of eco-innovations and, more generally, sociotechnical transitions. It develops a model that illustrates how financial constraints can prevent the development of eco-innovations within companies and hinder the transition process towards a more sustainable regime. Edgardo Sica presents a review of the state of the art, as well as new data from original surveys aimed at testing the impact of financial constraints on eco-innovative decisions at radical and niche levels. He proposes a definitive conceptualisation of eco-innovations while stressing the relevance of the environmental performance of innovations, rather than the environmental motivation of the innovators. Through the use of a unique multilevel perspective model, the book critically analyses the extent to which financial constraints can hinder eco-innovative decisions, thereby crucially filling a gap in the current literature on eco-innovations. Firms, Finance and Sustainable Transitions will prove a stimulating read for academics, researchers and experts within the fields of eco-innovations, sustainable development, financial and environmental economics, and green finance.   aDescription based on print record. 0aClean energy industriesxFinance. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788111812 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788111812/9781788111812.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881118297 a10.4337/97817881118292doi04090nam  22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002100196245044200217264005500659300003500714336002600749337002600775338003600801490005500837500002000892505077300912520157101685588003903256650004303295655002203338700003003360700003603390710004103426776002903467830005603496856005503552856004203607024003103649eep9781786436092UtOrBLW20180320080630.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786436092 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  ae------ 4aQC522b.E44 201800aElectricity network regulation in the EU :bthe challenges ahead for transmission and distribution /cedited by Leonardo Meeus (Director of the Energy Centre, Vlerick Business School, Belgium and Professor, Florence School of Regulation, European University Institute), and Jean-Michel Glachant (Holder of the Loyola de Palacio Chair on EU Energy Policy and Director, Florence School of Regulation, European University Institute, Italy). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (176 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aLoyola de Palacio series on European energy policy  aIncludes index.0 aContents -- Introduction -- Part I Incentive regulation: aligning the interests of the operators with the interests of their customers -- 1.

New grey areas at the frontiers of European power grids / Leonardo Meeus and Tim Schittekatte -- Index.  aThe UK model of incentive regulation of power grids was at one time the most advanced, and elements of it were adopted throughout the EU. This model worked well, particularly in the context of limited investment and innovation, a single and strong regulatory authority, and limited coordination between foreign grid operators. This enlightening book demonstrates how the landscape has changed markedly since 2010 and that regulation has had to work hard to catch up and evolve. As the EU enters a wave of investment and an era of new services and innovation, this has created growing tensions between national regulatory authorities in terms of coordinating technical standards and distribution systems. This is being played out against an increasingly disruptive backdrop of digitization, new market platforms and novel business models. Electricity Network Regulation in the EU adopts a truly European approach to the complex issues surrounding the topic, focusing on the grey areas and critical questions that have traditionally been difficult to answer. Incentive regulation and grids are addressed simultaneously at the theoretical and practical level, providing the reader with fundamental concepts and concrete examples. This timely book is an invaluable read for energy practitioners working in utility companies, regulators and other public bodies. It will also appeal to academics involved in the world of electricity regulation. The book utilizes language that would make it suitable for interdisciplinary students, including engineering and law scholars.   aDescription based on print record. 0aElectricityzEuropean Union countries. 0aElectronic books.1 aMeeus, Leonardo,eeditor.1 aGlachant, Jean-Michel,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786436085 (hardback) 0aLoyola de Palacio series on European energy policy.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786436085.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864360927 a10.4337/97817864360922doi11616nam  22004335i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184245035300204264004400557300003700601336002600638337002600664338003600690490007100726500002000797500012600817505316400943505348404107505236907591520073709960650003410697650004210731655002210773700003010795700004310825700004610868710004110914856008610955830006811041856004211109024003111151eep9781786434555UtOrBLW20180320080630.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||171031s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786434555 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB72b.R43 201800aRecent developments in economics and religion /cedited by Paul Oslington (Professor of Economics and Dean of Business, Alphacrucis College, Australia), Paul S.

The influence of religious ideas on the birth of economics as a discipline and its rise to cultural dominance is now widely recognized. The largely Protestant discussion has been enriched by Roman Catholic contributions stimulated by recent Papal Encyclicals. The economics of religion has now matured into a respectable subfield of economics and articles on religion regularly appear in top economics journals. This original and insightful research review places the most recent contributions in context and will be an invaluable resource for scholars and academics alike. 0aEconomicsxReligious aspects. 0aEconomicsxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aOslington, Paul,eeditor.1 aWilliams, Paul,dactive 2018,eeditor.1 aHirschfeld, Mary L.q(Mary Lee),eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781783470068/9781783470068.xml 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics ;v341.40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864345557 a10.4337/97817864345552doi03376nam  22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002200196245027400218264004900492300003400541336002600575337002600601338003600627500002000663505058000683520135601263588003902619650003402658655002202692700002802714700002902742710004102771776002902812856007602841856004202917024003102959eep9781788114387UtOrBLW20180320080630.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170825s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788114387 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  ae------ 4aHD8374b.I53 201800aIndustrial relations in emerging economies :bthe quest for inclusive development /cedited by Susan Hayter (Senior Industrial and Employment Relations Specialist, International Labour Office, Switzerland), and Chang-Hee Lee (Director, ILO Country Office for Viet Nam). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2018.  a1 online resource (240 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: 1.

Industrial Relations in Emerging Economies uses real-world examples to assess the relevance of the conceptual frameworks used to examine employment relations. The chapters focus on the evolution of industrial relations institutions and the role that these have played in periods of economic and political transition. They demonstrate that rather than acting as a constraint on development, trade unions can contribute to stability, security and equity. The contribution of industrial relations institutions to inclusive development nonetheless remains the subject of debate, viewed by some as increasingly irrelevant to the vast numbers of workers in the informal economy. The authors here, however, reveal a continuing demand for independent collective interest representation in labour relations, whether in the informal economy or in rapidly industrializing districts. This book will prove an interesting and stimulating read for students, academics and researchers in the fields of human resources, industrial relations, sociology and labour economics in addition to trade union researchers and policy-makers.   aDescription based on print record. 0aIndustrial relationszEurope. 0aElectronic books.1 aHayter, Susan,eeditor.1 aLee, Chang Hee,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788114370 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788114370/9781788114370.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881143877 a10.4337/97817881143872doi03206nam  22003615i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184100002600206245016700232264004900399300003400448336002600482337002600508338003600534500002000570505073600590520123101326588003902557650001402596655002202610710004102632776002902673856006902702856004202771024003102813eep9781788116879UtOrBLW20180320080630.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170914s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788116879 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHJ2321b.T36 20181 aTanzi, Vito,eauthor.14aThe ecology of tax systems :bfactors that shape the demand and supply of taxes /cVito Tanzi (Honorary President, International Institute of Public Finance, US). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2018.  a1 online resource (192 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Preface -- 1.

It specifically focuses on the role of the ecological environment on taxation; the factors that determine the ecology of taxation; and how the ecology of taxation has changed and may continue to evolve. Income taxes operate well in highly industrialized countries, characterized by large enterprises, modern accounting, thousands of workers and tangible products. There are great difficulties, however, when they operate in countries with higher levels of informality. Vito Tanzi addresses this effect and the influence of economic structure; the income distribution; globalization; technology; and various other main elements that determine the ecology of taxation. The implicit, important conclusion is that there are no permanent or universal optimal tax theories: all theories are related to this ecology. Students of taxation from various fields and economists interested in taxation and public finance will appreciate this book's new perspective on success and failure of taxes and tax systems. It will also serve as a useful resource for tax historians, policy experts, teachers, and tax theorists.   aDescription based on print record. 0aTaxation. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788116862 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788116862/9781788116862.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881168797 a10.4337/97817881168792doi04617nam  22003495i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184245012200204264004900326300003400375336002600409337002600435338003600461505209200497520135002589588003903939650003403978655002204012700003504034710004104069776002904110856005504139856004204194024003104236eep9781781953716UtOrBLW20180320080629.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||170824s2018    mau     o     000 0 eng    a9781781953716 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHN25b.H36 201800aHandbook of research on economic and social well-being /cedited by Conchita D'Ambrosio (Université du Luxembourg). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2018.  a1 online resource (608 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aContents: 1.

The novel complementary perspective by which each topic is addressed presents a broader outlook on the various dimensions of inequality and well-being. Each topic is assessed through two accompanying chapters: first, a detailed study of the theoretical approaches, followed by a supporting chapter of empirical findings. The original contributions cover themes ranging from human development to social exclusion, and from going beyond GDP as the primary indicator of progress to evaluating the persistence of poverty. The chapters also address measures of vulnerability and economic insecurity. The Handbook emphasizes the distributional aspects of inequalities across different groups through the analysis of polarization, segregation, and social fractionalization. This is an excellent Handbook for postgraduates and researchers in the social sciences and economics. The contributions rethink some of the traditional theories and models for measuring inequality and well-being, and push the boundaries for future research. The policy-relevant insights will also be of great use for social policy professionals and analysts.  aDescription based on print record. 0aWell-beingxEconomic aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aD'Ambrosio, Conchita,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781781953709 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781781953709.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817819537167 a10.4337/97817819537162doi03693nam  22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002000196100002700216245045700243264004400700300003500744336002600779337002600805338003600831490005700867504005100924505055600975520130701531588003902838650005802877655002202935700005602957710004103013776002903054830005803083856006903141856004203210024003103252eep9781786435309UtOrBLW20180320080630.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||171031s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781786435309 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  ad------ 4aJF60b.B34 20181 aBahl, Roy W.,eauthor.10aFiscal decentralization and local finance in developing countries /cRoy Bahl (Professor Emeritus, Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, US and Professor Extraordinarius, University of Pretoria, South Africa), and Richard M.

This book draws on experiences in developing countries to bridge the gap between the conventional textbook treatment of fiscal decentralization and the actual practice of subnational government finance. The extensive literature about the theory and practice is surveyed, and longstanding problems and new questions are addressed. There is no simple or single way to get decentralization right. To be successful, scholars of fiscal decentralization must pay close attention to the unique political, economic, and institutional context and objectives in each country. The authors focus on the key choices that must be made in decentralizing, on how economic and political factors shape the choices that countries make, and on how, by paying more attention to the need for a more comprehensive approach and the critical connections between different components of decentralization reform, everyone involved might get more for their money. Bahl and Bird have created a valuable resource for scholars, students, and practitioners from economics, public administration and management, planning, policy analysis, and political science.  aDescription based on print record. 0aDecentralization in governmentzDeveloping countries. 0aElectronic books.1 aBird, Richard M.q(Richard Miller),d1938-eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786435293 (hardback) 0aStudies in fiscal federalism and state-local finance.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786435293/9781786435293.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864353097 a10.4337/97817864353092doi05979nam  22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184100002900204245017800233264005500411300003400466336002600500337002600526338003600552500002000588505354400608520114704152588003905299650002605338650002105364655002205385710004105407776002905448856005505477856004205532024003105574eep9781788110266UtOrBLW20180425130130.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||171106s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788110266 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD82b.F34 20181 aFagerberg, Jan,eauthor.10aInnovation, economic development and policy :bselected essays /cJan Fagerberg (Professor, Centre for Technology, Innovation and Culture (TIK), University of Oslo, Norway). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (432 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Introduction / Jan Fagerberg -- Part I Essentials -- 1.

The first two sections present a comprehensive overview of our current knowledge on the phenomenon and analyse how this knowledge (and the scholarly community underpinning it) has evolved towards its present stance. The third part explores the role of innovation for growth and development, while section four is concerned with the national innovation system and the role of (innovation) policy in influencing its dynamics and responding to the important challenges facing contemporary societies. This comprehensive book is ideal for researchers and advanced students studying innovation theory, innovation policy and development issues. It encompasses the important advances of innovation research over the last two decades, providing a thorough insight into the evolution of the topic. Policymakers at the national or international level dealing with innovation would also greatly benefit from reading this book.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomic development. 0aPolicy sciences. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788110259 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788110259.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881102667 a10.4337/97817881102662doi05172nam  22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002200196245029400218264005500512300003400567336002600601337002600627338003600653500002000689505169700709520200002406588003904406650003404445650002604479655002204505700004004527710004104567776002904608856007604637856004204713024003104755eep9781788116299UtOrBLW20180425130131.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||171106s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788116299 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  ae------ 4aHD6336b.R43 201800aReducing inequalities in Europe :bhow industrial relations and labour policies can close the gap /cedited by Daniel Vaughan-Whitehead (Senior Economist, International Labour Office, Geneva, Switzerland and Professor, Sciences Po, Paris, France and the University of Geneva, Switzerland). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (640 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: 1.

Income inequality, now at its highest level for the past half-century, may not only undermine the sustainability of European social policy but also put at risk Europe's sustainable recovery. A common feature of recent reports on inequality (ILO, OECD, IMF, 2015-17) is their recognition that the causes emerge from mechanisms in the world of work. The purpose of this book is to investigate the possible role of industrial relations, and labour policies more generally, in reducing these inequalities. The book pays particular attention to the contribution of social partners and social dialogue to achieving concrete outcomes, notably in terms of flexibility and security for both employers and workers. The key aim is to identify elements of a response to a number of important questions: which countries have succeeded in carrying out the necessary reforms without generating further inequalities? What industrial relations systems seem to perform better in this respect? What policy measures, institutions and actors play a determinant role in achieving more balanced outcomes? How can social dialogue address future transformations of the world of work while limiting inequalities? The scope of this book goes beyond pay to address other types of inequality - in the distribution of working time, access or re-access to jobs, training and career opportunities, and social protection and pensions. It also looks at inequalities that may affect particular groups of workers, including women or young people, as well as people in certain types of work arrangements, such as part-time or temporary work or the self-employed. This book is vital reading for anyone concerned with labour policy, industrial relations and social welfare but, above all, with how advances in these areas can contribute to the global fight against growing inequalities.  aDescription based on print record. 0aIndustrial relationszEurope. 0aLabor policyzEurope. 0aElectronic books.1 aVaughan-Whitehead, Daniel,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788116282 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788116282/9781788116282.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881162997 a10.4337/97817881162992doi03371nam  22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184100002700206245015800233264005500391300003400446336002600480337002600506338003600532500002000568505072700588520137001315588003902685650002402724650001502748655002202763710004102785776002902826856006902855856004202924024003102966eep9781788117838UtOrBLW20180425130131.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||171106s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788117838 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD5650b.J67 20181 aJossa, Bruno,eauthor.12aA new model of socialism :bdemocratising economic production /cBruno Jossa (Professor of Political Economy, University 'Federico II' of Naples, Italy). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (256 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: 1.

This engaging book uses Marxist theory to hypothesise that capitalism is not a democratic system, and that a modern socialist system of producer cooperatives and democratically managed enterprises is urgently needed. A New Model of Socialism focuses on the current crisis of the political Left, a result of the collapse of the Soviet model of society and the decline of statism and kingship. Bruno Jossa expands on existing theories to explore Marx's notions on economic democracy in a modern setting. He advocates a move away from the centralised planning form of economic socialism towards a self-management system for firms that does not prioritise the interests of one class over another, in order to achieve greater economic democracy. It is argued that the establishment of such a system of democratic firms is the precondition for reducing intervention in the economy, thus enabling the State to perform its ultimate function of serving the public interest. This timely book is ideal for advanced scholars of Marxist, radical and heterodox economic theory, as well as academics with an interest in the rise of socialism in our modern world. Indeed, it will also be of value to all those seeking a viable and practical alternative to existing capitalist and socialist thinking.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEmployee ownership. 0aSocialism. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788117821 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788117821/9781788117821.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881178387 a10.4337/97817881178382doi03541nam  22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184245022900204264005500433300003500488336002600523337002600549338003600575490002900611500002000640505094600660520115901606588003902765650004602804655002202850700003102872700003302903710004102936776002902977856007603006856004203082024003103124eep9781788113489UtOrBLW20180425130131.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||171106s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788113489 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB75b.T43 201800aTeaching the history of economic thought :bintegrating historical perspectives into modern economics /cedited by Daniela Tavasci and Luigi Ventimiglia (School of Economics and Finance, Queen Mary University of London, UK). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (160 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aElgar guides to teaching  aIncludes index.0 aContents: 1.

It offers novel ways of integrating the history of economics into the curriculum, both in history of economic thought modules and in other sub-disciplines. Coming from a wide diversity of experiences, the contributors explore the idea that studying the history of thought exposes students to pluralism, and that it is therefore an essential pedagogical tool. They also argue that this method of teaching will reveal the historical contextualisation of current theories and show how they are the results of a specific evolution within the discipline. Ultimately, this book demonstrates how some modules have successfully operationalized both the history of economic thought and the teaching of various sub-disciplines from a historical perspective. Teaching the History of Economic Thought will be invaluable and enlightening for teaching and learning institutes across the academic world, as well as for economists, heterodox economists in particular, and social scientists.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSchools of economicsxStudy and teaching. 0aElectronic books.1 aTavasci, Daniela,eeditor.1 aVentimiglia, Luigi,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788113472 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788113472/9781788113472.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881134897 a10.4337/97817881134892doi07836nam  22003731u 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144050002300176245024100199264006200440300003500502336002600537337002600563338003600589490007100625500012600696504005100822505277800873505254303651520092706194650002307121655002207144700003507166710004107201830006107242856008607303856004207389024003107431eep9781786434548UtOrBLW20180425130129.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180417s2018    enk    fob    001 0 eng u  a9781786434548 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW 4aHC79.I55bA58 201800aRecent developments in the economics of information /cedited by Cristiano Antonelli (Professor of Economics, Department of Economics and Statistics "Cognetti de Martiis", University of Torino and Fellow, Collegio Carlo Alberto, Italy). 1aCheltenham, UK :bEdward Elgar Publishing Limited,c2018.  a1 online resource (936 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aThe international library of critical writings in economics series  aThe recommended readings are available in the print version, or may be available via the link to your library's holdings.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.8 aRecommended readings (Machine generated): 1.MichaelSpence(2002),'SignalinginRetrospectandtheInformationalStructureofMarkets',AmericanEconomicReview,92(3),June,434-59 -- 2.

It traces the unfolding of the fertile ambiguity and ambivalence of the notion of information with the identification and eventual separation of its two basic, quite distinct meanings: knowledge and signals. It documents the progressive understanding that it is not only necessary to search, screen and understand signals, but also to assess and select them so as to distinguish between true, false and fake ones. The capability to process signals and transform them into actual information stems from the stock of competence and knowledge that individuals and organizations possess and mobilize. The success of information economics paves the way to the economics of knowledge and this review will be an indispensable research tool for all those working and studying in the field.  0aKnowledge economy. 0aElectronic books.1 aAntonelli, Cristiano,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781786434531/9781786434531.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864345487 a10.4337/97817864345482doi14360nam  22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245030900205264005500514300003700569336002600606337002600632338003600658490007800694500012600772504005100898505358700949505322704536505357207763505160411335520060312939650001813542655002213560700005113582700003713633710004113670830006813711856008613779856004213865024003113907eep9781788110624UtOrBLW20180425130130.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau    fob    001 0 eng    a9781788110624 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB139b.A53 201800aVolatility.nVolume 1 /cedited by Torben G.

This comprehensive research review discusses some of the most important and influential journal articles by some of the leading scholars in the field. Subjects discussed include: an introduction to the economics of nonrenewable resources; theoretical foundations for the field; nonhomogeneous resources; exploration and uncertainty; market structure; taxation and global climate change. The research review concludes with a discussion of the empirical research and the extent to which nonrenewable resources constrain economic growth as well as the consistency of the theoretical predictions of Hotelling-type models with actual economic outcomes. 0aNonrenewable natural resources. 0aElectronic books.1 aHalvorsen, Robert,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics ;v343.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781781952238/9781781952238.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881117827 a10.4337/97817881117822doi06411nam  22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245024800205264004400453300003500497336002600532337002600558338003600584490003700620500002000657505211400677520272402791588003905515650001805554650002605572650002005598655002205618700003305640700005905673710004105732776002905773830003805802856007605840856004205916024003105958eep9781785366062UtOrBLW20180425130130.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||171101s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781785366062 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHT361b.T73 201800aTransportation, knowledge and space in urban and regional economics /cedited by Kakuya Matsushima (Graduate School of Urban Management, Kyoto University, Japan), and William P.

The featured studies employ the most current and sophisticated technologies, while the authors add a strong element of practical application and policy implications in each chapter. The book is organized into four major themes. The first is infrastructure and economic growth, addressing the historical and contemporary economic impacts of rail, highway and transit infrastructure. The second theme, models for transportation planning and policy, includes methods for optimal toll setting and the effect of transport costs on interregional trade. The third theme, which is the spatial structure of cities, examines processes that drive and arise from urban form, including personal interaction, shopping, commuting and residential location. The fourth theme is transformations in the knowledge economy, including growing income inequality and the role of knowledge in urban dynamics. This book will be of interest to the research communities in urban and regional economics and planning, regional science, transportation studies and the knowledge economy. With its emphasis on practical aspects, it will also be of interest to the policy community.

Moreover, it explores the rising significance of religion in Middle East and post-Soviet politics, as well as in current migration, security and party developments in the United States and Europe alike through these lenses. This book underscores the significance of religion as a crucial factor for political development and economic transformation, suggesting that all world religions can offer pathways to peace and development through different institutional channels. With a multiplicity of methods (statistical modeling, game theory, lab-in-the-field experiments, comparative historical analysis), the author observes how religion impacts political economy and international politics, and not always negatively. This demystification of religion goes beyond the classical discussion on the role of religion in the public sphere and sets the grounds for explaining why some economies are more likely to be democracies and others dictatorships. Researchers, graduate and undergraduate students of economics and social sciences, and faculty members who are interested in cutting-edge research on economics and culture will want this book in their collection. It insights will also be useful for policy-makers, administrators, historians, and civic organizations.   aDescription based on print record. 0aDevelopment economics. 0aReligion. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788110013 (hardback) 0aNew thinking in political economy.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788110013/9781788110013.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881100207 a10.4337/97817881100202doi03669nam  22004335i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002400196100003200220245038600252264005500638300003500693336002600728337002600754338003600780490005000816504005100866505048700917520138901404588003902793650002602832650003302858655002202891700002702913700003202940710004102972776002903013830005103042856006903093856004203162024003103204eep9781786436979UtOrBLW20180521061638.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781786436979 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  aa-kr--- 4aHD4904.7b.Y53 20181 aYi, Chu-ho,d1961-eauthor.10aHuman capital and development :blessons and insights from Korea's transformation /cJu-Ho Lee (Professor, KDI School of Public Policy and Management), Hyeok Jeong (Professor, Graduate School of International Studies, Seoul National University), and Song Chang Hong (Director, Division of Planning and Evaluation, Center for International Development, Korea Development Institute). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (328 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aKDI series in economic policy and development  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Foreword -- Introduction -- 1.

This pioneering work focuses on the key role of sustained investment in human capital behind Korea's phenomenal success. Human Capital and Development analyzes the importance of balancing diverse aspects of the educational system at different stages of development. The need to balance general and vocational education, top-down and bottom-up reform, as well as qualitative and quantitative expansion are highlighted. Adapting Korea's development experience to general principles shows that rather than seeking universal strategies and rules, the key to successful transformation is the provision of educational systems that can evolve over time depending on socio-economic and technological conditions for both developing and advanced countries. For researchers and students of economic development, education, and Asian development, this book is an excellent tool to discover possible ways for developing countries to initiate and accelerate their paths of economic growth and development. This book also provides a useful reference for policy makers of advanced as well as developing countries in designing their education systems and policies.   aDescription based on print record. 0aHuman capitalzKorea. 0aEconomic developmentzKorea. 0aElectronic books.1 aJeong, Hyeok,eauthor.1 aHong, Seong-Chang,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786436962 (hardback) 0aKDI series in economic policy and development.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786436962/9781786436962.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864369797 a10.4337/97817864369792doi10244nam  22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002300184245035000207264005500557300003500612336002600647337002600673338003600699490006400735500002000799500012600819505367100945505344304616505062908059520075208688650001509440650002309455655002209478700003509500700002609535710004109561830006109602856008609663856004209749024003109791eep9781784716134UtOrBLW20180521061638.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781784716134 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB171.5b.F54 201800aField experiments /cedited by John A.

Field experiments have gained popularity in recent years, allowing researchers to infer causal effects of different market environments, policies and interventions. The articles analysed here provide insights into market functioning and individual and group decision-making across a wide range of domains, including marketplace transactions, labor decisions, charitable giving, financial planning, and education and health-related decision-making. This research review will be an important resource for students new to the methodology and applications of field experiments and academics alike.  0aEconomics. 0aField experiments. 0aElectronic books.1 aList, John A.,d1968-eeditor.1 aSamek, Anya,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781781952245/9781781952245.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817847161347 a10.4337/97817847161342doi03870nam  22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245030500206264005500511300003500566336002600601337002600627338003600653490003800689500002000727505112500747520114601872588003903018650003703057650001503094655002203109700003803131700003303169710004103202776002903243830003903272856007603311856004203387024003103429eep9781788117937UtOrBLW20180521061638.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788117937 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHJ8015b.D43 201800aDebt default and democracy /cedited by Giuseppe Eusepi (Professor of Public Finance, Department of Law and Economics of Productive Activities, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy), and Richard E.

Through their thought-provoking views, leading scholars offer insights into the incentives that individuals and governments may have in resorting to public debt, thereby promoting a clearer understanding of its economic consequences. The authors explore public debt along two distinct but complementary analytical paths. One path concerns microeconomic aspects of public debt as it emerges through budgetary processes where individuals respond to the costs and gains of different courses of action. The other concerns the systemic properties of rational individuals acting within a democratic system of political economy. Within this scheme of thought, the two levels of analysis are integrated by recognition that efforts to control macro-level outcomes must address the micro-level circumstances and conditions that promote public debt as systemic budgetary outcomes. Scholars and students, as well as policy makers in public debt and political economy, will find this critical resource invaluable to understanding this vital issue.   aDescription based on print record. 0aDebts, PublicxEconomic aspects. 0aEconomics. 0aElectronic books.1 aEusepi, Giuseppe,d1949-eeditor.1 aWagner, Richard E.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788117920 (hardback) 0aNew thinking in political economy.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788117920/9781788117920.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881179377 a10.4337/97817881179372doi03585nam  22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184100003500204245027200239264005500511300003400566336002600600337002600626338003600652504005100688505091400739520122301653588003902876650003402915650002802949655002202977710004102999776002903040856006903069856004203138024003103180eep9781788113793UtOrBLW20180521061638.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||171107s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788113793 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD75b.A58 20181 aAntonelli, Cristiano,eauthor.14aThe evolutionary complexity of endogenous innovation :bthe engines of the creative response /cCristiano Antonelli (Professor of Economics, Department of Economics and Statistics "Cognetti de Martiis", University of Torino and Fellow, Collegio Carlo Alberto, Italy). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (288 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: 1.

In this book, Cristiano Antonelli elaborates, applies and tests, with his colleagues, the Schumpeterian framework established in the author's previous work Endogenous Innovation: The Economics of an Emergent System Property. The author carefully explores the role of the reactivity of firms to out-of-equilibrium conditions with a unique mix of econometric tools and simulation techniques. He examines the central role of knowledge externalities in shaping the likelihood of creative responses, and hence the generation of new knowledge and the introduction of innovations, as an alternative to adaptive responses that lead the system to equilibrium with no growth. In so doing, he confirms that innovation is the outcome of the interaction between individual decision-making and the endogenous and path-dependent properties of the system into which firms are embedded. This original and insightful work will be required reading for all those working on evolutionary economics, complexity economics and the economics of innovation and knowledge.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEndogenous growth (Economics) 0aEvolutionary economics. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788113786 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788113786/9781788113786.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881137937 a10.4337/97817881137932doi04469nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245018300206264005500389300003400444336002600478337002600504338003600530500002000566505177600586520123902362588003903601650004603640650003803686655002203724700003403746700003503780700003703815710004103852776002903893856007603922856004203998024003104040eep9781784718985UtOrBLW20180521061637.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781784718985 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD2326b.H36 201800aHandbook of behavioral industrial organization /cedited by Victor J.

The unique collective volume integrates behavioral concepts into the study of industrial organization to enhance understanding and interest in the subject. The Handbook of Behavioral Industrial Organization explores critical topics such as relative thinking, salience, shrouded attributes, overconfidence, status quo bias, identity and motivated reasoning (including cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias). The chapters link these behavioral concepts to industrial organization and consider multiple industries in order to present a well-rounded and composite approach. Additional chapters focus on industry issues such as those relating to the sports and gambling industries, neuroeconomic studies of brands and advertising, and behavioral antitrust law. Throughout the Handbook, authors use a variety of research methods such as literature surveys, experimental and econometric research and theoretical modelling, making the chapters accessible to a wide audience. Researchers, academics and economists in the fields of behavioral economics, industrial organization, regulation and consumer psychology will find this book stimulating and useful.  aDescription based on print record. 0aIndustrial organization (Economic theory) 0aEconomicsxPsychological aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aTremblay, Victor J.,eeditor.1 aSchroeder, Elizabeth,eeditor.1 aTremblay, Carol Horton,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781784718978 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781784718978/9781784718978.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817847189857 a10.4337/97817847189852doi05399nam  22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245031500205264005500520300003400575336002600609337002600635338003600661500002000697505257900717520132603296588003904622650002204661650002504683655002204708700003404730700003004764710004104794776002904835856007604864856004204940024003104982eep9781786435927UtOrBLW20180521061638.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786435927 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB615b.C74 201800aCreative industries and entrepreneurship :bparadigms in transition from a global perspective /cedited by Luciana Lazzeretti (Department of Business and Economics, University of Florence, Italy), and Marilena Vecco (CEREN, EA 7477, Burgundy School of Business, Université Bourgogne Franche-Comté, France). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (352 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Introduction / Luciana Lazzeretti and Marilena Vecco -- Part I: Cultural and creative industries and creative entrepreneurship: an overview -- 1.

In so doing, it investigates the evolving paradigm of creative industries and creative entrepreneurship and their related economy over time. Creative Industries and Entrepreneurship explores cultural and creative economics, management, entrepreneurship, international business, and urban and regional sciences, in both developed and newly emerging countries. The authors provide a framework to understand the evolving paradigm of creative industries and creative entrepreneurship while highlighting the distinction between 'first generation countries' such as the US, Canada, Australia and Europe, and 'second generation countries' in Asia, South America and North Africa. By adopting a multidisciplinary approach, the book develops a comprehensive overview of the composite phenomenon of the creative economy and its relationship with entrepreneurship. This inter-disciplinary work will appeal to researchers and scholars interested in creative industries, the creative economy and entrepreneurship, in addition to policy makers and managers within these areas. Readers will find an up-to-date presentation of existing and new research perspectives in these domains.   aDescription based on print record. 0aEntrepreneurship. 0aCultural industries. 0aElectronic books.1 aLazzeretti, Luciana,eeditor.1 aVecco, Marilena,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786435910 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786435910/9781786435910.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864359277 a10.4337/97817864359272doi04112nam  22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184100002800204245015500232264005500387300003500442336002600477337002600503338003600529490002900565500002000594505161400614520118602228588003903414650004403453655002203497710004103519776002903560856007603589856004203665024003103707eep9781786435323UtOrBLW20180521061638.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786435323 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD47b.F37 20181 aFarrow, Scott,eauthor.10aTeaching benefit-cost analysis :btools of the trade /cedited by Scott Farrow (Professor of Economics, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, US). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (264 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aElgar guides to teaching  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Preface: Teaching benefit-cost analysis -- Part I: The big picture -- 1.

Each chapter presents a self-contained module that includes guidance to additional resources, and many contain class exercises to provide detail and inspiration that extends beyond the scope of standard textbooks. The social evaluation of public investments by governments, international organizations and non-profits is an expanding field that encompasses both new and established areas of social policy. This book expands on the methods and issues central to the study of benefit-cost analysis, with specific topics including risk, societal distribution of impacts, limited versus national effects, the statistical value of a life and more. This book's focus on classroom engagement makes it a valuable resource for teachers of benefit-cost analysis. Its attention to foundational and advanced concepts will be of interest to undergraduate or Master's-level students of public policy, economics and related areas, as well as professional economists who apply benefit-cost analysis in their work.  aDescription based on print record. 0aCost effectivenessxStudy and teaching. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786435316 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786435316/9781786435316.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864353237 a10.4337/97817864353232doi04776nam  22004335i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245047300205264005500678300003500733336002600768337002600794338003600820490003700856500002000893505201900913520093302932588003903865650002203904650001503926650001903941655002203960700003203982700003904014700003204053710004104085776002904126830003804155856007604193856004204269024003104311eep9781786439901UtOrBLW20180614122138.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786439901 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB615b.G46 201800aGeography, open innovation and entrepreneurship /cedited by Urban Gråsjö (PhD, School of Business, Economics and IT, University West, Trollhättan), Charlie Karlsson (Professor Emeritus of the Economics of Technological Change, Jönköping International Business School, Jönköping University and Professor Emeritus, Blekinge Institute of Technology), and Iréne Bernhard (PhD, School of Business, Economics and IT, University West, Trollhättan, Sweden). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (400 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aNew horizons in regional science  aIncludes index.0 aContents: 1.

This book focuses on two specific but interrelated aspects of innovation by incumbent firms and entrepreneurs, the role of geography and of open innovation. Geography, Open Innovation and Entrepreneurship discusses entrepreneurship from both theoretical and empirical viewpoints to provide readers with a wide range of cutting-edge and compelling studies.

This volume challenges common but dated misconceptions of Korean industrial relations fixated on an economically successful but politically turbulent past. As Korea's employment relations continue to evolve, the accommodations made by companies and labor provide powerful insights for leaders in developing economies worldwide striving for prosperity, stability, and democratization. This book focuses on current realities both social and economic to uncover the potent challenges facing employers and workers in a slow-growth era of union decline. Lee and Kaufman provide a wide-ranging and global perspective authored by established and up-and-coming scholars both in and outside Korea in fields such as labor law, sociology, industrial relations, and labor economics. Up-to-date evaluation, data and analysis provide a modern and innovative perspective on employment and industrial relations practice. Scholars of global and specifically Asian industrial relations, human resource management and modern comparative labor relations will find this book of value. Policy makers and CEOs in emerging economics will benefit from the modern and innovative perspective on employment and industrial relations practice, including CEOs managing workplaces in South Korea.  aDescription based on print record. 0aIndustrial relationszKorea (South) 0aPersonnel managementzKorea (South) 0aElectronic books.1 aYi, Yŏng-myŏn,d1960-eeditor.1 aKaufman, Bruce E.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788113823 (hardback)z9781788113847 (pbk.)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788113823/9781788113823.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881138307 a10.4337/97817881138302doi08922nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184245027100204264005500475300003500530336002600565337002600591338003600617490007100653500002000724500012600744505383100870505247704701520095807178650002708136655002208163700003908185700003208224710004108256830006808297856008608365856004208451024003108493eep9781786431677UtOrBLW20180614122138.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180223s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786431677 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB90b.C66 201800aComparative economic systems /cedited by Paul Dragos Aligica (Senior Research Fellow, F.A.

By the mid 20th century an entire field had emerged, conceptualizing, theorizing, monitoring, and analyzing the largest and most consequential social and economic natural experiment in human history: Real-life Socialism. This research review focuses on the fundamental literature associated with the comparative study of socialist and capitalist systems. It features both a well-rounded inquiry of the modern history of economic thought, as well as a vibrant and critical disentanglement of the role of the economic system from the role of environment and policy decisions, as determinants of economic performance. This review will be an interesting and invaluable research resource for academics and students alike. 0aComparative economics. 0aElectronic books.1 aAligică, Paul Dragoș,eeditor.1 aBoettke, Peter J.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics ;v346.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781786431660/9781786431660.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864316777 a10.4337/97817864316772doi10689nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002400184245022800208264005500436300003500491336002600526337002600552338003600578490007100614500002000685500012600705505351500831505383304346505103808179520070709217650004809924655002209972700002909994710004110023830006810064856008610132856004210218024003110260eep9781786437372UtOrBLW20180614122138.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180223s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786437372 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD9502.A2bE26 201804aThe economics of renewable energy /cedited by Roger Fouquet (Associate Professorial Research Fellow, Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, London School of Economics and Political Science, UK). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (992 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aThe international library of critical writings in economics ;v347  aIncludes index.  aThe recommended readings are available in the print version, or may be available via the link to your library's holdings.8 aRecommended readings (Machine generated): 1.

From a modest role as a backstop technology in the 1970s to a central role in low carbon transitions today, the review reveals the emergence and growing importance of this sub-field of economics. Topics covered include the costs of renewable power (taking account of issues related to technological development, intermittency and interconnection), policies that promote renewable energy development, its public and private demand, and its impact on the environment and the economy. This comprehensive and indispensible review serves as an essential source of reference for students and researchers. 0aRenewable energy sourcesxEconomic aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aFouquet, Roger,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics ;v347.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781786437365/9781786437365.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864373727 a10.4337/97817864373722doi05195nam  22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245036400206264005500570300003400625336002600659337002600685338003600711505246900747520119403216588003904410650003304449650001704482655002204499700004704521700003404568710004104602776002904643856007604672856004204748024003104790eep9781784710842UtOrBLW20180614122137.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     o     000 0 eng    a9781784710842 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aJZ1305b.R47 201800aResearch handbook on economic diplomacy :bbilateral relations in a context of geopolitical change /cedited by Peter A.G. van Bergeijk (Professor of International Economics and Macroeconomics, Erasmus University), and Selwyn J.V.

In this Handbook over 30 leading experts from developed and developing countries, industrial nations and emerging economies have come together to form a global view of economic diplomacy. Representing a move away from Euro-centric books on the topic, this Handbook uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative research to explore how state visits, embassies and economic sanctions are being increasingly used as forms of diplomacy. Editors Peter van Bergeijk and Selwyn Moons have ensured that the entire research process is covered, from data collection to evidence based policy advice. As such, the Handbook reveals how and under which conditions economic diplomacy can be most effective, proving an invaluable tool for future research. The Research Handbook on Economic Diplomacy is a key resource for academics and researchers at policy institutions who wish to understand the field in greater depth. Policy makers and other actors at domestic and international levels would also greatly benefit from this extensive international view of economy diplomacy.  aDescription based on print record. 0aDiplomacyxEconomic aspects. 0aGeopolitics. 0aElectronic books.1 aBergeijk, Peter A.

This book addresses both the active and passive roles of cities in technology innovation, commercialisation, mass-production and adoption. In particular, it examines elements of three socio-technical systems, energy, transport and healthcare. The authors investigate cities in Europe, Asia and North America, providing an in depth understanding of the differences in leadership roles that cities adopt across the globe. The book breaks new ground in the analysis of topical issues such as local 'cradle' conditions, incentive schemes, niche-development, living labs, impact bonds, grass-roots intermediation and adaptive policy making. Researchers and students involved in the urban studies, socio-technical transitions and sustainability would greatly benefit from reading this book. The variety of practical examples also makes this book an important tool for city policy makers, as well as public policy and public sector scholars.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSustainable design. 0aCities and towns. 0aElectronic books.1 aGeenhuizen, M.

New modes of interacting on markets: online platforms -- 5. A concrete experiment of industrial policy for the manufacturing revolution -- 6. Conclusions: industrial policy for the manufacturing revolution -- Index.  aThe fourth industrial revolution is having a major impact on industry and societies primarily because of what has been called its raw material: data. New technologies are allowing hyper-connection on a global scale, not only between people, but also between people and machines and, in the case of the Internet of Things, even amongst machines themselves. This book offers a critical reflection on the meaning and expected consequences of the fourth industrial revolution, with a particular focus on the advent of digital globalisation and its implications for industrial policy. Industrial revolutions are considered not only in terms of technological progress, but also in the context of the changing relationship between market and production dynamics, and the social and political conditions enabling the development of new technologies. Industrial Policy for the Manufacturing Revolution aims to increase our capacity to anticipate and adapt to the forthcoming structural changes. It outlines the type of industrial policy and strategies that are needed in this era of rapid transformation. The authors propose a 'comprehensive industrial policy' that considers the complexity of structural changes involving industry as well as institutions and social and education policies, in order to encourage the participation of all citizens in the development process. The book also features a concrete example of comprehensive industrial policy implementation at the regional level. This stimulating and thoughtful book makes the case that industrial policies are more vital than ever, particularly now as the economy undergoes a technological revolution. It will be required reading for all those interested in industrial economics and policy, business and technology.  aDescription based on print record. 0aIndustrial policy. 0aTechnological innovationsxEconomic aspects. 0aTechnology and civilization. 0aElectronic books.1 aLabory, Sandrine,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786430311 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786430311/9781786430311.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864303287 a10.4337/97817864303282doi10776nam  22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245023700205264005500442300003700497336002600534337002600560338003600586490007100622500012600693505320500819505340804024505188507432520063509317650002309952655002209975700004609997700002710043710004110070793002810111830006810139856008610207856004210293024003110335eep9781785367434UtOrBLW20180723084635.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180402s2018    mau     o     000 0 eng    a9781785367434 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHG152b.F56 201800aFinance and growth.nVol. 1 /cedited by Asli Demirgüç-Kunt (Director of Research, The World Bank), and Ross Levine (Willis H.

The analysis focuses first on the basic decisions under uncertainty, and then on asset pricing. It further discusses both classical expected utility approach and its non-expected utility generalizations, with applications to dynamic portfolio choices, insurance, risk sharing, and risk prevention. This review will be valuable for scholars in finance and macroeconomics, particularly those with an interest in the modeling foundations of consumer and investor decisions under uncertainty.  0aRisk. 0aUncertainty. 0aElectronic books.1 aGollier, Christian,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.  aBackstage Library Works 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics ;v348.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781786432742/9781786432742.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864327597 a10.4337/97817864327592doi03397nam  22004335i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002200196100003800218245061600256264005500872300003400927336002600961337002600987338003601013504005101049505044901100520095601549588003902505650003702544650003002581655002202611700003202633700002902665700002902694710004102723776002902764793002802793856006902821856004202890024003102932eep9781785360138UtOrBLW20180723084634.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781785360138 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  aa-ja--- 4aHG3977b.I86 20181 aItō, Takatoshi,d1950-eauthor.10aManaging currency risk :bhow Japanese firms choose invoicing currency /cTakatoshi Ito (Professor, School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, US, Senior Professor, National Graduate Institute for Public Studies, Japan and RIETI), Satoshi Koibuchi (Professor, Faculty of Commerce, Chuo University, Japan and RIETI), Kiyotaka Sato ( Professor, Department of Economics, Yokohama National University, Japan, Adjunct Professor, School of Business and Law, Edith Cowan University, Australia and RIETI), and Junko Shimizu (Professor, Faculty of Economics, Gakushuin University, Japan and RIETI). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (288 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: 1.

In this book, the authors examine why this is the case, particularly for those exporters who have a strong presence in global markets. Managing Currency Risk enhances our understanding of exporters' behaviour by analysing the key factors that influence their choice of invoice currency. Detailed research based on unique data sets is used to highlight how firm size, product competitiveness, intra/inter-firm trade and the geography of export destination impact this decision. This book is a valuable resource for international finance researchers and political economists wishing to discover up-to-date information regarding currency invoicing by multinational firms. It will also be a vital tool for financial and governmental practitioners to discover more about their competitors' behaviour.  aDescription based on print record. 0aForeign exchange optionszJapan. 0aCurrency questionzJapan. 0aElectronic books.1 aKoibuchi, Satoshi,eauthor.1 aSato, Kiyotaka,eauthor.1 aShimizu, Junko,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781785360121 (hardback)  aBackstage Library Works40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781785360121/9781785360121.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817853601387 a10.4337/97817853601382doi05055nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184245025800204264005500462300003400517336002600551337002600577338003600603500002000639505214600659520144902805588003904254650002604293650001304319655002204332700002904354700002704383710004104410776002904451793002804480856007604508856004204584024003104626eep9781785360510UtOrBLW20180723084634.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180116s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781785360510 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD82b.H36 201800aHandbook of finance and development /cedited by Thorsten Beck (Professor of Banking and Finance, Cass Business School, UK), and Ross Levine (Willis H.

Containing chapters on theory, empirical work and historic accounts, this is the first Handbook to provide a comprehensive overview of the fields of finance and development. As leading researchers in the field the contributors analyse the emergence of, and innovations in, financial instruments, markets and intermediaries, providing commentary on how these components of financial systems shape resource allocation, poverty, income inequality and aggregate economic growth. They also explore the causes and consequences of financial fragility, the historic development of financial systems, and the regulatory and supervisory underpinnings of financial sector development. Further chapters examine financial development at both the aggregate and country levels and assess the degree to which individuals and firms can access financial services. Recent literature on the financial inclusion of households and enterprises is also analysed.

This never happened. By reconsidering the classical-Marxian tradition using modern tools of economic analysis, this book offers an alternative to the mainstream understanding of notions of value, price, and competition, concepts which serve as the foundation for a theoretically and empirically robust economic theory. Providing a unique synthesis of modern input-output analysis and classical political economics, this book combines current economic theory with historical economic thought. In this way, Value, Competition and Exploitation offers a deeper and more nuanced understanding of today's economic problems than can be gained through mainstream approaches. With a rigorous and empirically informed approach to classical theories of value and price, this book demonstrates that Marx's labor theory of value remains a valuable tool in understanding the structure and dynamics of capitalist economies. Written in an accessible style and presented with a clear structure, this book will be invaluable to economics students of all levels. The topics analyzed will also be of interest to scholars of classical and Marxian economics, as well as scholars of economics more widely.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSchools of economics. 0aElectronic books.1 aFlaschel, Peter,d1943-eauthor.1 aFranke, Reiner,eauthor.1 aFröhlich, Nils,eauthor.1 aVeneziani, Roberto,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786430632 (hardback)  aBackstage Library Works40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786430632.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864306497 a10.4337/97817864306492doi02823nam  22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184100002900205245014700234264005500381300003400436336002600470337002600496338003600522504005100558505029600609520118100905588003902086650002802125650002202153655002202175710004102197776002902238793002802267856006902295856004202364024003102406eep9781781003718UtOrBLW20180723084634.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180223s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781781003718 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB238b.M67 20181 aMosca, Manuela,eauthor.10aMonopoly power and competition :bthe Italian marginalist perspective /cManuela Mosca (Full Professor, University of Salento (Lecce), Italy). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (256 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Introduction -- 1.

Manuela Mosca analyses their articulate vision of competition, and the structural and strategic entry barriers considered in their works to enrich existing literature on the history of the sources of market power. The book is not limited to the reconstruction of the elaboration of pure theory, it also highlights its policy implications and how this group applied their theories as cutting-edge experiments in analysing the labour market, socialism, the Great War and gender issues, against the background of the political situation of the period. Monopoly Power and Competition is a vital resource for historians of economic thought, as it explores a relatively untouched area of microeconomics from a historical perspective, and reveals the theories surrounding monopoly power and competition. Microeconomists and industrial organisation scholars would similarly benefit from the knowledge of the origins of many microeconomic tools and notions.  aDescription based on print record. 0aCompetition, Imperfect. 0aMarginal utility. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781781003701 (hardback)  aBackstage Library Works40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781781003701/9781781003701.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817810037187 a10.4337/97817810037182doi03737nam  22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245026400206264005500470300003500525336002600560337002600586338003600612490003900648500002000687505115200707520098201859588003902841650002502880655002202905700002902927700003902956700003302995710004103028776002903069793002803098830004003126856007603166856004203242024003103284eep9781786439864UtOrBLW20180723084634.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180124s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786439864 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB99.7b.M66 201800aMoney, method and contemporary Post-Keynesian economics /cedited by Sheila Dow (Emeritus Professor of Economics, University of Stirling, UK), Jesper Jespersen (Professor of Economics, Roskilde University, Denmark), and Geoff Tily (Senior Economist, TUC, UK). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (208 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aNew directions in modern economics  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Introduction -- Acknowledgements -- 1.

On that basis, this book focuses on the failures of the market economic system to secure stability and sustainability, and demonstrates why this is not recognised by conventional economic theory. The Post-Keynesian economics set out here aims for an understanding of the economy as a whole and as an integral part of society. Chapters analysing money, banks and finance as dynamic phenomena open the book. They are followed by chapters focusing on methodological issues such as uncertainty, longer-term aspects, sustainability and other non-monetary economic activities. This important book is a useful tool for students and researchers who wish to gain a better understanding of real world economics. In these areas where conventional macroeconomic theory may not be sufficient, this book offers viable Post-Keynesian alternatives.  aDescription based on print record. 0aKeynesian economics. 0aElectronic books.1 aDow, Sheila C.,eeditor.1 aJespersen, Jesper,d1948-eeditor.1 aTily, Geoff,d1965-eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786439857 (hardback)  aBackstage Library Works 0aNew directions in modern economics.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786439857/9781786439857.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864398647 a10.4337/97817864398642doi04122nam  22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002300184245025900207264005500466300003500521336002600556337002600582338003600608490003900644500002000683505126400703520125101967588003903218650003303257655002203290700002903312700003903341700003303380710004103413776002903454793002803483830004003511856007603551856004203627024003103669eep9781786439888UtOrBLW20180723084634.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180124s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786439888 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB172.5b.G46 201804aThe General Theory and Keynes for the 21st century /cedited by Sheila Dow (Emeritus Professor of Economics, University of Stirling, UK), Jesper Jespersen (Professor of Economics, Roskilde University, Denmark), and Geoff Tily (Senior Economist, TUC, UK). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (232 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aNew directions in modern economics  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Introduction -- 1.

A number of contributions take their departure from Keynes's presentation during the 1930s of his new macroeconomic understanding and its policy implications. The book also discusses pluralistic views of Keynes's ideas and their importance for contemporary debates. The General Theory and Keynes for the 21st Century develops the analysis of money and banking, and the intertwined relationship between financial and real-world activities throughout. It demonstrates how vital Keynes's work is to understanding the failure of the globalised financial system as well as pointing to an alternative way forward. The broad scope and richness of the contributions are reminders of how most books severely misrepresent The General Theory and therefore fail to act as a guide to 21st Century policy. As such, this book is a necessary tool for scholars, researchers and advanced students of economics, as well as policy makers who wish to create a more just society in the face of the current deregulated global market economy.  aDescription based on print record. 0aMacroeconomicsxMethodology. 0aElectronic books.1 aDow, Sheila C.,eeditor.1 aJespersen, Jesper,d1948-eeditor.1 aTily, Geoff,d1965-eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786439871 (hardback)  aBackstage Library Works 0aNew directions in modern economics.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786439871/9781786439871.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864398887 a10.4337/97817864398882doi02356nam  22003615i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050001900184245012300203264005500326300003400381336002600415337002600441338003600467505010700503520098700610588003901597650004501636655002201681710006501703710004101768776002901809793002801838856005501866856004201921024003101963eep9781788974585UtOrBLW20180723084634.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180524s2018    mau     o     000 0 eng    a9781788974585 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aTN1b.W67 201800aWorld statistics on mining and utilities 2018 /cUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization (Vienna, Austria). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (200 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aContents: About this publication -- Introduction -- Part I: Summary tables -- Part II: Country tables.  aWorld Statistics on Mining and Utilities 2018 provides a unique biennial overview of the role of mining and utility activities in the world economy.

Examining the classical theories that stress gains from trade stemming from comparative advantage, the review also analyses more recent theories of imperfect competition, where any potential gains from trade can stem from competitive effects or the international transmission of knowledge. Empirical contributions provide evidence regarding the explanatory power of these various theories, including work on the effects of trade openness on economic growth, wages, and income inequality, as well as evidence on the effects of trade on firm productivity, entry and exit. This review will be an invaluable research resource for academics, practitioners and those drawn to this fascinating topic. 0aFree trade. 0aInternational trade. 0aElectronic books.1 aWacziarg, Romain,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781788111492/9781788111492.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881115087 a10.4337/97817881115082doi03394nam  22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184100002900205245015900234264005500393300003500448336002600483337002600509338003600535490005000571500002000621505042900641520164201070650003002712655002202742710004102764776002902805830004402834856006902878856004202947024003102989eep9781788118736UtOrBLW20180821070622.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180223s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788118736 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aGV716b.G64 20181 aGoff, Brian L.,eauthor.10aSports economics uncut /cBrian Goff (Distinguished Professor, Department of Economics, Gordon Ford College of Business, Western Kentucky University, US). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (208 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aNew horizons in the economics of sport series  aIncludes index.0 aContents : 1.

Sports Economics Uncut expresses this insight from Nelson Mandela, exploring sports as a fascinating mirror of the world and a powerful agent of change. In this book, Brian Goff covers subjects ranging from the ebb and flow of racial discrimination, to inequality, law enforcement, managers and risky decisions, club membership, and politics. Much more than merely a review or synthesis, this work extends existing perspectives and explores provocative questions such as: how systematic is racial bias in pro sports today? Is all racial segregation in sports due to racial bias? How much are college athletes really worth, and is league parity really optimal?  This book highlights the fascinating paradox of the modest revenues spent on sports but the enormous intangible value of it. The author explains how recent evidence of racial bias in sports actually illustrates how much ground has been gained in society on racial matters; how the scandals of college sports are a built-in feature of a world in which football and basketball athletes are worth millions; how athletic skill can vary widely across and within regions and races, and how this can influence positioning decisions; and how managers reflect both traditional economic views of decision making and more recent behavioral views.  While drawing from widespread academic studies, this is a lively presentation accessible to a wide audience, with extensive but easy to digest data. Students and scholars of sports economics, as well as those studying sports analysis or related areas, will find it an engaging and eye-opening read. 0aSportsxEconomic aspects. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788118729 (hardback) 0aNew horizons in the economics of sport.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788118729/9781788118729.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881187367 a10.4337/97817881187362doi05214nam  22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002700196100003200223245018000255264005500435300003400490336002600524337002600550338003600576500002000612504004100632505224100673520161502914650004004529650002504569655002204594710004104616776002904657856006904686856004204755024003104797eep9781788119498UtOrBLW20180821070622.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180509s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788119498 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  an-us--- 4aHB3717 2008b.D37 20181 aD'Arista, Jane W.,eauthor.10aAll fall down :bdebt, deregulation and financial crises /cJane D'Arista (Research Associate, Political Economy Research Institute, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, US). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (264 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.  aIncludes bibliographical references.0 aContents: 1.

Rising stocks of debt drove the global financial system into crisis in 2008 when households, businesses, financial institutions and the public sector in some countries strained to generate sufficient income for debt service. The stagnation and fall in asset prices that followed began the process of unwinding that led to a run on the financial sector by the financial sector. This engaging examination describes critical developments that changed the structure of US financial markets as well as developments and innovations in US credit markets that created the context for crisis. It discusses the advent of dollar hegemony, the critical role of international reserves in generating credit, the emergence of the debt bubble in the 1980s and the mounting risks of debt in the new millennium. The author also proposes a systemic approach to monetary control, offering two new reform proposals. The analysis concludes that reforms are needed in order to support sustainable economic activity in the US and global economies. This volume will appeal to students and scholars of economics interested in international finance and banking, financial regulation and monetary policy implementation. It will also be of interest to business economists, lawyers, policymakers and journalists concerned with the effects of financial instability and involved in ongoing debates on financial and monetary reform. 0aGlobal Financial Crisis, 2008-2009. 0aDebtzUnited States. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788119481 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788119481/9781788119481.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881194987 a10.4337/97817881194982doi03913nam  22004335i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245017900206264005500385300003500440336002600475337002600501338003600527490002700563500002000590504004100610505093200651520141701583650004103000650002403041650003303065650005003098655002203148700003103170700003103201710004103232776002903273830002803302856007603330856004203406024003103448eep9781786433459UtOrBLW20180821070622.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180223s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781786433459 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF1008b.R47 201802aA research agenda for service innovation /cedited by Fa�iz, Gallouj and Faridah Djellal, (Professors of Economics and members of CLERSE-CNRS, University of Lille, France). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (200 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aElgar research agendas  aIncludes index.  aIncludes bibliographical references.0 aContents: 1.

Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. Over the last two decades, Service Innovation Studies (SIS) has achieved 15 distinct and important advances. This Research Agenda outlines these major developments, setting out the research priorities in the field. Fa�iz Gallouj and Faridah Djellal have drawn together an array of renowned contributors to create a multidisciplinary analysis of the topic that illustrates the strength of this research trajectory. International experts in the field of SIS consider the issue of innovation in services in relation to a number of major contemporary challenges, including environmental issues, social inclusion, economic development, gender, ethical issues, religion and public organizations. Moving from an overview of the 15 advances already made, this Research Agenda outlines the 15 main challenges that could structure research over the next decade, distinguishing between societal challenges, organizational and structural challenges, and methodological and didactic challenges. This is an enlightening book for both services and innovation scholars in the fields of economics, management science and public administration who wish to develop further research in SIS. 0aBusinessxTechnological innovations. 0aBusinessxResearch. 0aCustomer servicesxResearch. 0aCustomer servicesxTechnological innovations. 0aElectronic books.1 aDjellal, Faridah,eeditor.1 aGallouj, Fa�iz,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786433442 (hardback) 0aElgar research agendas.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786433442/9781786433442.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864334597 a10.4337/97817864334592doi04087nam  22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245037200206264005500578300003500633336002600668337002600694338003600720490003700756500002000793505136300813520105202176588003903228650002403267655002203291700003003313700003503343700004203378710004103420776002903461830003803490856007603528856004203604024003103646eep9781785368950UtOrBLW20180912094616.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180509s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781785368950 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF1025b.G56 201800aGlobal city makers :beconomic actors and practices in the world city network /cedited by Michael Hoyler (Geography and Environment, School of Social Sciences, Loughborough University, UK), Christof Parnreiter (Institute of Geography, Hamburg University, Germany), and Allan Watson (Geography and Environment, School of Social Sciences, Loughborough University, UK). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (224 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aNew horizons in regional science  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Prologue: The global city: enabling economic intermediation and bearing its costs / Saskia Sassen -- 1.

Engaging critically and constructively with global urban studies from a relational economic geography perspective, the book outlines a renewed agenda for global cities research. This book conceptualizes global cities as places from where the world economy is managed and controlled, and discusses the significance of economic actors and their practices in the formation of the world city network. Focusing on financial services, management consultancy, real estate, commodity trading and maritime industries, the detailed case studies are located across the globe to incorporate major global cities such as London, New York and Tokyo as well as globalizing cities including Mexico City, Hamburg and Mumbai. This ground-breaking book will appeal to a broad audience including scholars in urban studies, economic geography and international management as well as urban policy-makers and practitioners in globalizing firms.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomic geography. 0aElectronic books.1 aHoyler, Michael,eeditor.1 aParnreiter, Christof,eeditor.1 aWatson, Allan,dactive 2018,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781785368943 (hardback) 0aNew horizons in regional science.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781785368943/9781785368943.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817853689507 a10.4337/97817853689502doi03200nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002100196100005100217245013800268264005500406300003500461336002600496337002600522338003600548490004300584504005100627505031900678520145500997588003902452650003302491655002202524710004102546776002902587830004402616856006902660856004202729024003102771eep9781784716912UtOrBLW20180912094616.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180509s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781784716912 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  aa-cc--- 4aHC427b.Z43 20181 aZhang, Fanc(Professor of economics),eauthor.14aThe institutional evolution of China :bgovernment vs market /cFan Zhang (National School of Development, Peking University, China). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (320 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aAdvances in new institutional analysis  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Preface -- 1.

Fan Zhang challenges traditional theory to explain the real origins of China's reform, the political and economic forces driving it, and the reasoning behind its stagnation. The institutional re-arrangement of government and market has been crucial in this marketization process. Using a wealth of documents and cases, Zhang provides a detailed analysis of China's institutional changes over the past 40 years, focusing on the government-market relationship. A theoretical framework is presented to explain the targets and incentives of government and business firms in a bureaucratic-market system, which promoted economic growth, but also fostered corruption and resulted in a re-centralisation of the system. Using an index of marketization in China since 1978, Zhang shows that overall, market expansion has continued but with diminishing marginal gains. The government control of financial resources that had previously been relaxed in the early years of reform has been enhanced to some extent as a result of the changing institutional environment. Policy makers dealing with China-related policies, researchers and postgraduate students in political science, economics and Chinese studies will find this book a compelling exploration of the current and constant cooperation and conflict between government and market.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomic developmentzChina. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781784716905 (hardback) 0aAdvances in new institutional analysis.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781784716905/9781784716905.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817847169127 a10.4337/97817847169122doi03704nam  22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002100196100003500217245019000252264005500442300003500497336002600532337002600558338003600584490004800620500002000668505094200688520127601630588003902906650003302945650003302978655002203011710004103033776002903074830004903103856006903152856004203221024003103263eep9781784715960UtOrBLW20180912094616.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180223s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781784715960 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  aa-cc--- 4aHC427b.Z43 20181 aZhao, Hongjun,d1970-eauthor.10aChina's long-term economic development :bhow have economy and governance evolved since 500 BC? /cHongjun Zhao (Professor of Economics and Business, Shanghai Normal University, China). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (384 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aAdvances in Chinese economic studies series  aIncludes index.0 aContents: 1.

Through its broad exploration of the style, strength, and effectiveness of Chinese governance through the years, it touches on a universal relationship between economic development and governance and institutions, translating the experiences of one of the world's oldest civilizations into widespread, current economic relevance. Hongjun Zhao first examines the formation of Chinese style governance, the core contents of this governance, and its vitality compared with other governance patterns in Chinese history. He also discusses the effectiveness of this governance pattern in supporting the economic development before the Song dynasty, the failure of this governance during the past 3-5 centuries and the governmental role in pushing development since 1978. Finally, he makes a prediction of the direction of Chinese governance patterns in over the next 20-30 years. Scholars and researchers interested in China's long term economic development will appreciate this comprehensive examination of the subject, as will high level undergraduate and graduate students interested in keeping pace with China's rapid development.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomic developmentzChina. 0aCorporate governancezChina. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781784715953 (hardback) 0aAdvances in Chinese economic studies series.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781784715953/9781784715953.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817847159607 a10.4337/97817847159602doi08100nam  22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184245028200204264005500486300003500541336002600576337002600602338003600628490006400664500002000728500012600748505280300874505275803677505014406435520072006579650002607299650001307325655002207338700002907360700002807389710004107417830006107458856008607519856004207605024003107647eep9781786439352UtOrBLW20180912094617.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180516s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786439352 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD82b.E26 201800aEconomic growth and poverty /cedited by Nanak Kakwani (Former Professor and Head of the Department of Economics, University of New South Wales, Australia), Hyun Hwa Son (Principle Evaluation Specialist, Independent Evaluation Development, Asian Development Bank, Philippines). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (912 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aThe international library of critical writings in economics  aIncludes index.  aThe recommended readings are available in the print version, or may be available via the link to your library's holdings.8 aRecommended readings (Machine generated): 1.

A substantial amount of research has been carried out using cross-country regression models, resulting in a better and improved understanding of the linkage between economic growth and poverty reduction. The literature on cross-country regressions, however, has led to conflicting conclusions. Reconciling diverging messages makes it difficult to accurately inform policy-making. Based on a selection of influential papers, this volume provides a critical review of the literature. Scholars who envision a world free of extreme poverty will find this analysis particularly valuable. 0aEconomic development. 0aPoverty. 0aElectronic books.1 aKakwani, Nanak,eeditor.1 aSon, Hyun Hwa,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781786439345/9781786439345.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864393527 a10.4337/97817864393522doi08893nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245011600206264005500322300003500377336002600412337002600438338003600464490006400500500002000564500012600584505337500710505353704085520051407622650001708136650002908153655002208182700003008204710004108234830006108275856008608336856004208422024003108464eep9781788117555UtOrBLW20180912094617.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180509s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788117555 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aML3790b.E26 201804aThe economics of music /cedited by Samuel Cameron (former Professor of Economics, University of Bradford, UK). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (768 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aThe international library of critical writings in economics  aIncludes index.  aThe recommended readings are available in the print version, or may be available via the link to your library's holdings.8 aRecommended readings (Machine generated): 1.

Sport is an effective industry in which to empirically test theories of personnel economics, primarily because the employer-employee relationship in sport is much more visible and transparent than in almost any other industry. Researchers benefit from having data on a host of variables pertaining to individual employees (players), such as their age, race, national origin, and experience. Researchers also have data on each employee's performance, on their salary, and on who their co-workers (teammates) and managers (coaches) are. The chapters are organized around the core functional areas of personnel economics and cover all aspects of the employment relationship in sport - from recruiting and selection, to pay and performance, to work team design. Each chapter contains a thorough literature review that provides the reader with a sense of the breadth and depth of the work being done in the area, and with a sense as to how the literature can move forward, both in a sport and non-sport context. The book is suitable for an advanced undergraduate course right through to a postgraduate field-course in both management and economics. Academic researchers in the fields of sports economics, personnel economics, human resource management, strategic management and sport management will also find the book of interest.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSportsxEconomic aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aLongley, Neil,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786430908 (hardback) 0aNew horizons in the economics of sport.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786430908/9781786430908.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864309157 a10.4337/97817864309152doi04832nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002500196245027300221264005500494300003400549336002600583337002600609338003600635500002000671505210600691520119402797588003903991651004504030655002204075700003604097700005004133700003204183710004104215776002904256856007604285856004204361024003104403eep9781788971140UtOrBLW20181011075148.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180518s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788971140 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  ae------ 4aHN380.5.A8bS77 201800aStructural reforms for growth and cohesion :blessons and challenges for CESEE countries and a modern Europe /cedited by Ewald Nowotny (Governor), Doris Ritzberger-Grünwald (Director), and Helene Schuberth (Head of Division, Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Austria). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (256 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Part I A modern take on structural reforms -- 1.

This book examines the achievements and failures of past structural policies so that new concepts can evolve to address remaining and newly emerging challenges with greater success. Tangible policy advice is offered in the original contributions to this book, reassessing past 'moments of truth' in European structural policy. The book focuses on the area of Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE), not least because this region has been largely successful through a profound transition period. Highlighting the social aspects and distributional effects of reforms that go beyond liberalization and deregulation, the book covers key issues facing Europe in the future, particularly those arising from technological innovation. Structural Reforms for Growth and Cohesion will prove to be a useful book for academic researchers looking into European policy progress and reform. Indeed, it will also be a vital reference tool for policymakers seeking to deepen their understanding of the challenges facing a modern Europe and how these can be tackled.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEuropean Union countriesxSocial policy. 0aElectronic books.1 aNowotny, Ewald,d1944-eeditor.1 aRitzberger-Grünwald, Doris,d1961-eeditor.1 aSchuberth, Helene,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788971133 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788971133/9781788971133.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889711407 a10.4337/97817889711402doi08631nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002300184245011200207264004900319300003500368336002600403337002600429338003600455490007100491500002000562505317900582505322003761505029306981520050007274500012607774650001307900655002207913700003007935710004107965830006808006856008608074856004208160024003108202eep9781786436955UtOrBLW20181011075148.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180808s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786436955 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHC79.P63bM43 201800aMeasuring poverty /cedited by Stephan Klasen (Professor of Economics, University of Göttingen, Germany). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2018.  a1 online resource (872 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aThe international library of critical writings in economics ;v353  aIncludes index.8 aRecommended readings (Machine generated): 1.

Conclusion -- References -- Indexx.  aThe solar photovoltaic sector is moving forward very fast, both in terms of its own technological advancement and its standing among global renewable energy technologies. Rapid increases in solar cell efficiencies, fast technical change in solar batteries and solar glass, and economies of scale in production fuel its rapid adoption, and it is becoming clear that existing forecasts about its adoption need to be updated extensively. This timely and distinctive examination of the economic side of the field takes into account solar PV's recent and growing lead among renewable energies competing to replace fossil fuels. The Revolution in Energy Technology examines the birth of this technology in the United States, where the main innovators are still located, the emergence of China as a main production hub, and new and growing contributions to the innovation cascades from other countries including Germany, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The participation of universities as investors and the role of venture capital are discussed, and particular emphasis is given to the domination of the sector by large firms. The book is interesting for both academics and graduate students as well as policy-makers, technicians, engineers and companies involved in the field.  aDescription based on print record. 0aPhotovoltaic power generationzUnited States. 0aElectronic books.1 aNiosi, Jorge,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788115650 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788115650/9781788115650.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881156677 a10.4337/97817881156672doi03977nam  22003615i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184100003900204245015400243264005500397300003400452336002600486337002600512338003600538500002000574505142000594520130402014588003903318650002403357655002203381710004103403776002903444856006903473856004203542024003103584eep9781788971980UtOrBLW20181107092626.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180524s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788971980 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB75b.W45 20181 aWhite, Colinq(Colin M.),eauthor.12aA history of the global economy :bthe inevitable accident /cColin White (former Professor of Economics, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (512 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Preface -- Part I: Introduction -- 1.

He veers away from traditional Eurocentric approaches, providing a truly global scope for readers. A History of the Global Economy takes a holistic, interdisciplinary approach, beyond the narrow application of economic theory, to include the impact of climate change, genetics and culture. The main themes include the creative innovativeness of humans and how this generates economic progression, the common economic pathway trodden by all societies and the complementary relationship between government and the market. The book moves through the four key economic stages of human history - foraging, agriculture, industry and services - to finally examine where the direction of our future may lie. This comprehensive and ambitious book is a must-read for economists, particularly economic historians, as well as anthropology and political history scholars. It not only explores the history and origins of the global economy but also provides a valuable analysis of the current state of economic affairs, making it an ideal book for those wishing to understand more about our ever-evolving global society.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomicsxHistory. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788971973 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788971973/9781788971973.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889719807 a10.4337/97817889719802doi04048nam  22003615i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245026800206264004900474300003400523336002600557337002600583338003600609500002000645505135200665520131002017588003903327650004603366655002203412700003303434710004103467776002903508856007603537856004203613024003103655eep9781788972635UtOrBLW20181107092627.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180808s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788972635 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHG3881b.P65 201804aThe political economy of international finance in an age of inequality :bsoft currencies, hard landings /cedited by Gerald A.

This keen analysis of key topics in international finance takes a heterodox perspective, with focus on the role of inequalities in power in shaping the structure and outcomes in the international sphere. The Political Economy of International Finance in an Age of Inequality begins with a discussion of capital flows and financial crisis, moves into an up-to-date discussion of the political economy of currency unions, and then focuses on analysis of capital flows and economic crises. New and established academics present a broad variety of special case studies within that general framework focusing on understudied yet important up to date cases from understudied regions and countries for a unique and important exploration of the field. This book will be of interest to students and specialists in international finance, who will benefit from the combination of the strong general framework and illustrative case studies. Its approach will appeal both to generalists and specialists.  aDescription based on print record. 0aInternational financexPolitical aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aEpstein, Gerald A.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788972628 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788972628/9781788972628.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889726357 a10.4337/97817889726352doi03745nam  22003615i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184100003700205245036900242264005500611300003400666336002600700337002600726338003600752504005100788505071300839520153601552588003903088650002203127655002203149710004103171776002903212856006903241856004203310024003103352eep9780857935465UtOrBLW20181211091636.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180509s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng d  a9780857935465 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB615b.G73 20181 aGranstrand, Ove,d1944-eauthor.10aEvolving properties of intellectual capitalism :bpatents and innovations for growth and welfare /cOve Granstrand (Professor in Industrial Management and Economics, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden and Research Fellow at the Institute for Management of Technology and Innovation and Chairman of the Innovation and IP Research Group, www.ip-research.org). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub., Inc.,c2018.  a1 online resource (520 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Preface -- 1.

The creation of intellectual capital and intellectual properties lies at its heart. This eagerly anticipated book analyzes the many complex links between R&D, patents, innovations, entrepreneurship, growth and value creation in this process. Based on an extensive array of national empirical and policy studies, Ove Granstrand explores a comprehensive range of innovation and intellectual property (IP) issues that pertain not only to Europe but to the entire world. These issues include the role of patents and licensing in the governance of technology and innovation, and the many uses and abuses of patents. The text also details new IP phenomena in an increasingly patent-intensive world with patent-rich multinationals and patent-savvy new entrants from Asia. In a world facing challenges that call for innovative responses, this book contains a set of valuable policy recommendations for strengthening innovativeness for economic growth and ultimately for social value creation. This timely book will be a valuable resource for economics, law and management scholars wishing to gain a thorough understanding of the topic. Practitioners and policy-makers will also greatly benefit from reading this volume, following up on the author's widely acclaimed book published in 1999 The Economics and Management of Intellectual Property: Towards Intellectual Capitalism.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEntrepreneurship. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9780857935458 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9780857935458/9780857935458.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97808579354657 a10.4337/97808579354652doi04402nam  22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245037000205264005500575300003500630336002600665337002600691338003600717490002700753500002000780505136900800520135902169588003903528650002403567650002603591655002203617700003503639700002903674700003003703710004103733776002903774830002803803856007603831856004203907024003103949eep9781785360299UtOrBLW20181211091636.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180524s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng d  a9781785360299 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHT388b.R47 201802aA research agenda for regeneration economies :breading city-regions /cedited by John R.

Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. City-regions are regeneration economies, or in other words, places that are experiencing on-going processes of recovery, adaptation or transformation. This Research Agenda provides both a state-of-the-art review of existing research on city-regions, and expands on new research approaches. Expert contributors from across the globe explore key areas of research for reading city-regions, including: trade, services and people, regional differentiation, big data, global production networks, governance and policy, and regional development. The book focuses on developing a more integrated and systematic approach to reading city-regions as part of regeneration economies, by identifying conceptual and methodological developments in this field of study. Students in geography, urban studies and city and regional planning will greatly benefit from reading this, as it provides a wealth of stimuli for essays and dissertation topics. Advanced business and public policy students will also benefit from the focus on translating research into practice, an approach that this Research Agenda takes in several chapters.  aDescription based on print record. 0aRegional economics. 0aEconomic development. 0aElectronic books.1 aBryson, J.

Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. In recent years, an explosive rise in computing power and the digitization of data has allowed researchers in new institutional economics (NIE) to investigate questions that could never before be systematically analysed. This book explores key issues for future research in the field, analysing both traditional areas of focus in NIE and more recent areas of interest. Consisting of 30 concise chapters written by top NIE scholars, this Research Agenda probes issues at the forefront of NIE, including government, contracts, property rights, norms, culture, and beliefs. Analysing rapid changes in technology and the environment, such as the rise of social media and the effects of climate change in agriculture, this book offers unique insights into key contemporary issues. Written in non-technical terms, this book will inform and inspire students and those starting their careers in economics, law and political science. NIE scholars will also find the book invaluable in updating their understanding of crucial research questions and seeking new areas to explore.  aDescription based on print record. 0aInstitutional economics. 0aElectronic books.1 aMénard, Claude,d1944-eeditor.1 aShirley, Mary M.,d1945-eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788112505 (hardback) 0aElgar research agendas.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788112505/9781788112505.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881125127 a10.4337/97817881125122doi05322nam  22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245041900205264004900624300003500673336002600708337002600734338003600760490005900796500002000855505238900875520126503264588003904529650001304568655002204581700003004603700004004633700003204673710004104705776002904746856007604775856004204851024003104893eep9781788973069UtOrBLW20181211091637.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180808s2018    mau     o     001 0 eng d  a9781788973069 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHG173b.B44 201804aThe behavioural finance revolution :ba new approach to financial policies and regulations /cedited by Riccardo Viale (University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy and Herbert Simon Society), Shabnam Mousavi (John Hopkins University, Carey Business School, US and Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Germany), and Barbara Alemanni (University of Genoa and Umberto Filotto, University of Rome "Tor Vergata", Italy). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2018.  a1 online resource (272 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aBehavioural financial regulation and policy (BEFAIRLY)  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Salvatore Rossi -- Foreword -- Introduction / Barbara Alemanni, Umberto Filotto, Shabnam Mousavi, Riccardo Viale -- Part I -- The many faces of finance in the academia -- 1.

Regulators strive to predict ways in which they can malfunction and create rules to prevent this from happening, yet behavioural impacts are often overlooked. This book explores how behavioural finance can go hand-in-hand with traditional methods to help banks and regulators create better policies. It also demonstrates how the behavioural finance revolution has opened the way to a more integrated approach to the analysis of economic phenomena. This book adopts a forward-looking agenda that takes account of existing practices based on behavioural science. It focuses on how to make financial markets an arena for fair play as a central criterion for securing and enhancing societal well being. It examines how bounded rationality, heuristic decision making, aversion to losses, endowment effects and social preferences may impact financial decisions, thus exposing the flaws in traditional forecasting methods that rely on an over-simplified representation of the individual. With contributions from both academics and practitioners, this book will be fundamental reading for researchers in the finance and behavioural economics. Regulators who wish to utilise behavioural policymaking will also find this a beneficial read.  aDescription based on print record. 0aFinance. 0aElectronic books.1 aViale, Riccardo,eeditor.1 aModarres-Mousavi, Shabnam,eeditor.1 aAlemanni, Barbara,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788973052 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788973052/9781788973052.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889730697 a10.4337/97817889730692doi
