Including a range of different viewpoints, the book analyses women's position at work from three perspectives: the constraints affecting women's career advancements, gender-specific challenges to women in leadership roles, and women's experiences of undertaking these roles while trying to maintain a work-life balance. By highlighting the specific disadvantages relating to gender, chapters outline the extent of change needed culturally, as well as through policy and attitude, if women are to achieve parity with their male counterparts. Researchers and students of gender in management, leadership and organisation studies will find this a thought-provoking read, particularly those studying work-family balance and the future paths to breaking the glass ceiling for women in business.  aDescription based on print record. 0aBusinesswomen. 0aLeadership in women. 0aElectronic books.1 aAntoniou, Alexander-Stamatios G.,eeditor.1 aCooper, Cary L.,eeditor.1 aGatrell, Caroline,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786432704 (hardback) 0aNew horizons in management.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786432704/9781786432704.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864327117 a10.4337/97817864327112doi04762nam a22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245022400206264005100430300003400481336002600515337002600541338003600567505248100603520090603084588003903990650002904029650003104058655002204089700002704111700003104138710004104169776002904210856007604239856004204315024003104357eep9781788112574UtOrBLW20190814141532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190708s2019    mau     o     000 0 eng    a9781788112574 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHC79.E5bH36 201900aHandbook of sustainable innovation /cedited by Frank Boons (professor of innovation and sustainability) and Andrew McMeekin (professor of innovation, University of Manchester and Sustainable Consumption Institute, UK). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (416 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aContents: 1.

Customer centricity is not just about segmentation or short-term marketing tactics. Rather, it represents an organization-wide philosophy that focuses on the systematic and continuous alignment of the firm's internal architecture, strategy, capabilities, and offerings with external customers. This philosophy means that to be truly customer-centric, firms need to make multilevel transformations in internal architecture and organizational design, including leadership, metrics, incentives, structure, processes, and systems. These reorganizations are often accompanied by reshaped relational strategies, such as customer loyalty programs and marketing channel strategies that make customer centricity a reality. These changes also need to be backed by reconfigurations of brand and technological capabilities, as manifested in healthy customer-centric brands and in technology systems and skills that enable customer centricity at scale. The contributors to this book provide current thinking and cutting-edge research to further scholars' understanding of this key concept in marketing. Academics teaching or researching customer centricity, consultants implementing customer centricity and managers directly implementing customer centricity in their organizations will come to rely on the Handbook of Customer Centricity. Marketing associations, industry associations and local and university libraries will find the insights within offer critical reflection on the key features of customer centricity and the detailed roadmap to achieve it"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aMarketing. 0aCustomer relations. 0aElectronic books.1 aPalmatier, Robert W.,eeditor.1 aMoorman, Christine,eeditor.1 aLee, Ju-Yeon,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788113595 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788113595/9781788113595.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881136017 a10.4337/97817881136012doi03583nam a22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184100003300206245030400239264005100543300003400594336002600628337002600654338003600680504005100716505058800767520152201355588003902877650001902916655002202935700004002957710004102997776002903038856006903067856004203136024003103178eep9781788118835UtOrBLW20190814141532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190708s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788118835 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD8036b.W55 20191 aWilliams, Colin C.,eauthor.10aDependent self-employment :btheory, practice and policy /cColin C.

Unpacking a comprehensive survey of 35 European countries, Colin C. Williams and Ioana Alexandra Horodnic map the lived realities of the distribution and characteristics of dependent self-employment to challenge this broad and erroneous perception. Featuring rigorous empirical research, Dependent Self-Employment moves beyond the reliance on anecdotal evidence to fill in gaping lacunae in our understanding of employment. Reporting on the European Working Conditions Survey of 2015, this impressive book provides a crucial contribution to our understanding of dependent self-employment in the 21st century, challenging not only academic perceptions, but also depictions of work in the media and political discourse. The authors expertly navigate the 'grey zone' of defining dependent self-employment, embracing the spectrum of employment relationships and outlining the limits to the rights and authority of the dependently self-employed. Bold and comprehensive, this timely book offers critical insight for researchers at all levels exploring the nature and distribution of employment in Europe. Given the current public debates on the platform economy, this book will also prove useful for practitioners and policy-makers in labour inspectorates, tax administrations and social security institutions worldwide"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSelf-employed. 0aElectronic books.1 aHorodnic, Ioana Alexandra,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788118828 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788118828/9781788118828.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881188357 a10.4337/97817881188352doi04940nam a22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040002300144042000800167050002100175245063300196264005100829300003400880336002600914337002600940338003600966490005701002500002001059505207201079520093103151588003904082650002204121650001804143650002004161655002804181700003104209700003204240700002704272710004104299776002904340856007604369856004204445024003104487eep9781788116213UtOrBLW20190925184705.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190925s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788116213 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLC  apcc 4aHB615b.H36 201900aHandbook of research on entrepreneurship and aging /cedited by Mikaela Backman (assistant professor economics, Center for Entrepreneurship and Spatial Economics, Jönköping International Business School, Jönköping University), Charlie Karlsson (professor emeritus of the economics of technological change, Jönköping International Business School, Jönköping University and professor emeritus of industrial economics, Blekinge Institute of Technology) and Orsa Kekezi (PhD candidate, Center for Entrepreneurship and Spatial Economics, Jönköping International Business School, Jönköping University, Sweden). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (448 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aResearch handbooks in business and management series  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Introduction to the handbook of research on entrepreneurship and aging / Mikaela Backman, Charlie Karlsson and Orsa Kekezi -- Part I: The international perspective -- 1.

One possible outcome of this new demographic structure is that more individuals will become entrepreneurs at an older age. This Handbook contributes to the important and emerging field of entrepreneurship among this group and focuses on the behavioral perspectives of this phenomenon; on innovation, dynamics and performance; and the ways entrepreneurship among the elderly looks within different countries. Researchers interested in the field of entrepreneurship among older workers and policy makers dealing with the effects of changing demographic settings within countries or regions will turn to this work to gain a better understanding of entrepreneurship and aging"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEntrepreneurship. 0aOlder people. 0aBusinesspeople. 7aElectronic books.2lcsh1 aBackman, Mikaela,eeditor.1 aKarlsson, Charlie,eeditor.1 aKekezi, Orsa,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788116206 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788116206/9781788116206.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881162137 a10.4337/97817881162132doi07713nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040002300144042000800167050002400175245033700199264005100536300003400587336002600621337002600647338003600673490005000709500002000759505477000779520140505549588003906954650001906993655002807012700003307040700003507073710004107108776002907149856007607178856004207254024003107296eep9781788116695UtOrBLW20190930152107.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190930s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788116695 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLC  apcc 4aHD4904.7b.H36 201900aHandbook of research on strategic human capital resources /cedited by Anthony J.

Work in this area requires the integration of multiple theoretical perspectives and empirical approaches, but that integration rarely occurs. Within these pages, the editors have combined the voices of leading scholars from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds to provide a comprehensive introduction to the current state of the field. The Handbook of Research on Strategic Human Capital Resources brings together fifty-one prominent Strategy, OB, HRM, and OT researchers who share a scholarly interest in human capital resources (HCR). These authors draw on their diverse expertise and backgrounds to explore two broad domains of questions: how do we conceptualize HCRs and how do we actuate HCRs in organizations? These two domains each comprise four topics, and each topic is examined through 'micro' and 'macro' perspectives. In this way, the authors in each topic area shine a light on commonalities and differences in their scholarly perspectives surrounding HCR theory and practice. The result is a foundational and definitive volume for understanding the current state and future directions of HCR research, making it invaluable for scholars interested in learning more about HCRs, doctoral students across a variety of fields, and practitioners"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aHuman capital. 7aElectronic books.2lcsh1 aNyberg, Anthony J.,eeditor.1 aMoliterno, Thomas P.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788116688 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788116688/9781788116688.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881166957 a10.4337/97817881166952doi06506nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040002300144042000800167050002700175245026500202264005100467300003400518336002600552337002600578338003600604490005700640500002000697505395900717520101904676588003905695650002605734650003805760655002805798700003405826700002905860710004105889776002905930856007605959856004206035024003106077eep9781788117739UtOrBLW20190930160154.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190930s2019    mau     of    001 0 eng    a9781788117739 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLC  apcc 4aHF5415.1255b.H36 201900aHandbook of research on identity theory in marketing /cedited by Americus Reed II (professor of marketing, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania) and Mark Forehand (professor of marketing, The Foster School of Business, University of Washington, US). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (496 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aResearch handbooks in business and management series  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Introduction.

The Handbook explores [1] what makes an identity come to mind [2] what creates strong associations between identities and products [3] how consumers use brands to verify who they are or want to become [4] how consumption enhances or resolves conflict amongst identities and [5] how marketing and consumption becomes particularly relevant to particular identities. Each of these five principles are fully analyzed by a who's who of world-class international marketing scholars. This Handbook is a comprehensive and state of the art treatment of identity and marketing: An authoritative and practical guide for academics, brand managers, marketers, public policy advocates and even intellectually curious consumers"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aBranding (Marketing)  0aIdentity (Philosophical concept)  7aElectronic books.2lcsh1 aReed, Americus,cII,eeditor.1 aForehand, Mark,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788117722 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788117722/9781788117722.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881177397 a10.4337/97817881177392doi04844nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040002300144042000800167050002200175245062200197264005100819300003400870336002600904337002600930338003600956500002000992505151301012520144602525588003903971650001904010650002504029655002804054700003104082700003804113700003204151700003204183710004104215776002904256856007604285856004204361024003104403eep9781788118712UtOrBLW20190930122357.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190930s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788118712 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLC  apcc 4aHD6053b.H54 201900aHigh-growth women's entrepreneurship :bprograms, policies and practices /cedited by Amanda Bullough (associate professor of management and co-director and co-founder of the Women's Leadership Initiative, University of Delaware), Diana M.

This book was written to address this reality and focuses on the high-growth potential of women entrepreneurs. The scholars in this book conducted qualitative as well as quantitative research in contexts around the world, including Eswatini (Swaziland), Australia, China, Slovenia, Peru, and one global study of 43 countries. Chapters are organized according to three key themes: the practice of building networks, programs and the support environment, and policies and regulations. Topics addressed within these themes include the interconnected and mutually reinforcing features of a fruitful entrepreneurial culture, including financial and human capital advancement and readiness, new opportunities for expansion and an assortment of institutional and infrastructural provisions for innovation and business growth. High-growth Women's Entrepreneurship will appeal to public and private sector managers, policy makers and politicians who want to promote a culture and ecosystem that supports women's growth-oriented business potential. Educators and program designers who want to help women grow their businesses, and scholars who want to explore further research will find the information invaluable"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aBusinesswomen. 0aLeadership in women. 7aElectronic books.2lcsh1 aBullough, Amanda,eeditor.1 aHechavarría, Diana M.,eeditor.1 aBrush, Candida G.,eeditor.1 aEdelman, Linda F.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788118705 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788118705/9781788118705.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881187127 a10.4337/97817881187122doi05062nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040002300144042000800167050002100175245034300196264005100539300003400590336002600624337002600650338003600676500002000712504004100732505208600773520143502859588003904294650001004333650001304343655002804356700003104384700003004415710004104445776002904486856007604515856004204591024003104633eep9781788979443UtOrBLW20190930124037.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190930s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788979443 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLC  apcc 4aBD216b.O74 201900aOrganizing hope :bnarratives for a better future /cedited by Daniel Ericsson (associate professor, School of Business and Economics, Linnaeus University, Sweden) and Monika Kostera (professor and chair in management, Jagiellonian University, Krakw̤, Poland and professor in management and organization, Sd̲ertr̲n University, Sweden). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (264 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.  aIncludes bibliographical references.0 aContents: Prologue by Anke Strau.

In this timely book, this contemporary crisis is explored and illuminated, providing narratives that suggest how the notion of hope can be leveraged to create powerful methods of organizing for the future, in communities, workplaces and businesses. In response to the increasing attention being paid to the shocking seriousness of the current state of the world, this innovative book offers a variety of ways of bringing hope into a situation otherwise defined by hopelessness, following a tradition of radical dissent by public intellectuals such as Zygmunt Bauman and Vaclav Havel. Chapters first consider theoretical and philosophical perspectives on hopeful organizing, followed by both empirical discussions about achieving change and more imaginative narratives of alternative and utopian futures, including an exploration of the differing roles of work, creativity, idealism, inclusivity and activism. Organizing Hope will be a critical and thought-provoking read for researchers and students of organization theory and sociology, as well as other social sciences. Politicians, policy makers and other decision makers in government will also find the book insightful and useful"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aHope. 0aUtopias. 7aElectronic books.2lcsh1 aEricsson, Daniel,eeditor.1 aKostera, Monika,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788979436 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788979436/9781788979436.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889794437 a10.4337/97817889794432doi05063nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040002300144042000800167050002200175245044500197264005100642300003400693336002600727337002600753338003600779490005200815500002000867505206500887520123202952588003904184650002104223650004304244655002804287700003204315700003404347710004104381776002904422830005304451856007604504856004204580024003104622eep9781789903058UtOrBLW20190930131352.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190930s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781789903058 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLC  apcc 4aHF5387b.E84 201900aEthical business leadership in troubling times /cedited by Joanne B.

Moreover, do the responsibilities of business change when there are social problems or problems with other institutions? Immigration, Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, and the emergence of populism and nationalism on both sides of the Atlantic raise some ethical challenges for business leaders. The chapters in this book tackle several aspects of these questions with chapters on business and politics, the environmental responsibilities of business, the social and political impact of technology, immigration, the impact of social turmoil on organizational leadership, and broader questions of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility), leadership, and governance in times of social turmoil. Academics and students who study CSR as well as those who study business ethics, business and society, or business and government are not the only readers who will find insight in Ethical Business Leadership in Troubling Times. Practitioners who oversee corporate CSR programs, compliance officers, and social and political philosophers and ethicists will benefit from these explorations into the complexities of business ethics"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aBusiness ethics. 0aLeadershipxMoral and ethical aspects. 7aElectronic books.2lcsh1 aCiulla, Joanne B.,eeditor.1 aScharding, Tobey K.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781789903041 (hardback) 0aStudies in transatlantic business ethics series.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781789903041/9781789903041.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817899030587 a10.4337/97817899030582doi06378nam a22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002600184245021500210264006600425300003500491336002600526337002600552338003600578490005700614500002000671505354900691520125204240588003905492650002405531650002405555650003005579655002205609700004005631700003705671700002905708710004105737776002905778856007605807856004205883024003105925eep9780857938602UtOrBLW20190221074531.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181009s2019    mau     of    001 0 eng    a9780857938602 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF5415.129b.H36 201900aHandbook of research on distribution channels /cedited by Charles A.

In this Handbook the authors present cutting-edge research on channel management and design from analytical, conceptual, and empirical perspectives. The ultimate objective of this Handbook is a comprehensive theory of distribution channels for scholars presented in enlightened surveys of the literature to tightly reasoned investigations. Channel management topics include value creation, interorganizational knowledge transfer, contract design, governance and control, and relationship management. Channel design topics encompass coordination, supply-chain management, price vs. quantity competition, channel breadth, franchising, resale price maintenance, and bricks-and-mortar vs. online retailer competition. The book concludes with a sketch of a Comprehensive Theory of Distribution Channels meant to incorporate and extend current thinking. The breadth of this Handbook makes it appropriate for use in a doctoral course on distribution channels, or as a knowledge-broadening resource for faculty and researchers who wish to understand types of channels research that are outside the scope of their own approach to distribution.  aDescription based on print record. 0aMarketing channels. 0aBusiness logistics. 0aFranchises (Retail trade) 0aElectronic books.1 aIngene, Charles A.,d1947-eeditor.1 aBrown, James R.,d1947-eeditor.1 aDant, Rajiv P.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9780857938596 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9780857938596/9780857938596.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97808579386027 a10.4337/97808579386022doi03974nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002600184245012600210264006600336300003500402336002600437337002600463338003600489490005000525500002000575505154100595520109802136588003903234650002203273650002303295655002203318700002903340710004103369776002903410856007603439856004203515024003103557eep9781788115384UtOrBLW20190221074531.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181005s2019    mau     of    001 0 eng    a9781788115384 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF5415.127b.H36 201900aHandbook of research on gender and marketing /cedited by Susan Dobscha (professor of marketing, Bentley University, US). 1aNorthampton, Massachusetts :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (352 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aResearch handbooks in business and management  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Introduction / Susan Dobscha -- 1.

This Handbook's main objective is to provide a roadmap through the complicated terrain of gender as it pertains to marketing and consumer behavior. The book also emphasizes that the study of gender is not restricted to certain theories, methods, or approaches. The unifying conclusion is that the study of gender is an important topic that has not received the attention it deserves within the marketing discipline; and attention to gender is crucial now more than ever. This book will give marketing scholars the guidance they need to incorporate the topic of gender into their research by highlighting the current conversations that are taking place in the field of marketing, and more importantly, by illuminating the gap in which more scholarship is necessary to increase our understanding of gender complexities.  aDescription based on print record. 0aTarget marketing. 0aConsumer behavior. 0aElectronic books.1 aDobscha, Susan,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788115377 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788115377/9781788115377.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881153847 a10.4337/97817881153842doi05454nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002300184245039500207264006600602300003400668336002600702337002600728338003600754500002000790505210800810520169302918588003904611650005304650650002504703650002604728655002204754700003304776700002804809710004104837776002904878856007604907856004204983024003105025eep9781788974714UtOrBLW20190221074531.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181009s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788974714 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aLC191.9b.U55 201900aUniversity and society :binterdependencies and exchange /cedited by Ágnes Kövér (associate professor and director, Gender Studies MA Program, Eötvös Lorand Science University (ELTE), University School of Social Sciences, Budapest, Hungary) and Gaby Franger (emeritus professor, faculty of social work and health, Coburg University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Coburg, Germany). 1aNorthampton, Massachusetts :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (336 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Introductory thoughts / Ágnes Kövér and Gaby Franger -- Part I.

Must it remain segregated in the halls of science and knowledge, which tower above the community? This book examines the growing number of questions and concerns around university-community relations by exploring widely accepted theories and practices and placing them under new light. From a shared point of agreement that the university is an institution which should move beyond the production of higher knowledge for power elites, the contributors provide critical reflections and reports on efforts to bring about change in the canonic discourse or power-biased attitudes in universities throughout the Northern Hemisphere and Australia. The central message is that the strengthening of direct relations between universities and communities is vital to the construction of social capital and to the opening of universities to society. These are processes to be advanced on both local and international levels, as they involve democratizing rather than corporatizing, extending the reach of our educational process, sharing knowledge, resources, and expertise and reinforcing community decision-making and problem-solving capacity. How these processes of change develop and unfold within a number of universities in a wide range of countries is the story told in this book. This book will appeal to a wide readership, from students and community activists looking to make education meaningful and cooperative, to educational policy makers, members of the professoriate, and academic administrators, seeking to sustain withering institutions and provide vision for new program developments.  aDescription based on print record. 0aUniversities and collegesxSociological aspects. 0aCommunity activists. 0aCommunity and school. 0aElectronic books.1 aKövér, Ágnes,eeditor.1 aFranger, Gaby,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788974707 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788974707/9781788974707.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889747147 a10.4337/97817889747142doi03305nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245015400206264006600360300003400426336002600460337002600486338003600512500002000548505076900568520117501337588003902512650003102551650002502582650001602607655002202623700003302645710004102678776005102719856007602770856004202846024003102888eep9781788976244UtOrBLW20190221074531.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181009s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788976244 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aT173.8b.A38 201900aAdvanced imagineering :bdesigning innovation as collective creation /cedited by Diane Nijs (Breda University of Applied Sciences, the Netherlands). 1aNorthampton, Massachusetts :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (224 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Foreword / Benyamin Lichtenstein -- Preface -- 1.

Articulating and illustrating how experience design can unlock experience innovation, Diane Nijs and her colleagues present new ways of effectuating corporate, public, social and whole system innovation through collective creation. This ground-breaking book makes several contributions to the fields of innovation and design thinking by taking complexity science as its point of reference. It shows how two complementary types of science - a Newtonian equilibrium science of forces and a complexity science of simple rules - lead to two types of innovation policy and two complementary types of design thinking. By enhancing conventional design thinking with the systemic design approach of imagineering, this book offers readers a fresh perspective on innovation in times of growing complexity. This is a highly provocative book for scholars, practitioners and students in the field of change and innovation. It will also prove to be a useful tool for design thinking in management systems.  aDescription based on print record. 0aTechnological innovations. 0aMedical innovations. 0aInventions. 0aElectronic books.1 aNijs, Diane,d1962-eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788976237 (hardback)z9781789902853 (pbk.)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788976237/9781788976237.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889762447 a10.4337/97817889762442doi05549nam a22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002400184245022900208264004900437300003400486336002600520337002600546338003600572500002000608505285000628520130503478588003904783650004504822655002204867700003104889700003604920710004104956776002904997856007605026856004205102024003105144eep9781788113427UtOrBLW20190123074037.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180924s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788113427 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF5548.8b.C74 201900aCreating psychologically healthy workplaces /cedited by Ronald J.

This book explores ways to combat the factors contributing to an unhealthy workplace by building on the advances in positive psychology and organizational scholarship over the last 15 years. Focusing on ground-breaking concepts such as psychological capital, 'happiness compassion', virtuousness, support and gratitude, this book offers ways to target and reshape the unhealthy workplace environment. Each chapter provides real-life organizational situations in which companies of all sizes implement strategies that either hinder or successfully create a healthy workplace environment. The world-leading authors identify key causes that reduce employee satisfaction and job performance, offering a range of interventions that can prevent negative experiences to ultimately produce happier workforces and boost productivity. This book will be a vital reference for doctoral students studying the links between work and health as well as faculty studying ways to improve employee well-being. Those on advanced courses in human resource management, organization effectiveness and organizational change will also benefit from the vast array of international insights into a healthy workplace environment.  aDescription based on print record. 0aWork environmentxPsychological aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aBurke, Ronald J.,eeditor.1 aRichardsen, Astrid M.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788113410 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788113410/9781788113410.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881134277 a10.4337/97817881134272doi03278nam a22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117035001800144035002000162040003200182042000800214050002100222100003000243245005300273264005100326300004000377336002600417337002600443338003600469490006900505504005100574505041200625520145001037588003902487650001902526650001402545655002202559710004102581776002902622830006302651856006902714856004202783024003102825eep9781786436894UtOrBLW20190718115532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190708s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781786436894 (e-book)  a(DLC)21057403  a(DLC)2019945348  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHM891b.L64 20191 aLogue, Danielle,eauthor.10aTheories of social innovation /cDanielle Logue. 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (vii, 179 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aElgar introductions to management and organization theory series  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Introduction: The aim and structure of the book -- 1.

But what exactly is 'social innovation'? And how can it help us to think about problems such as inequality, poverty and climate change? Danielle Logue theorizes social innovation as a contemporary manifestation of the historical tensions between 'economy' and 'society' and the simultaneous pursuit of economic and social progress. Going back to the historical work of Adam Smith and his discussion of markets and morality, the author draws on organizational and management theory to present three theoretical lenses for understanding social innovation. These lenses include theorizing social innovation as social value creation, capture and distribution; social innovation as polysemous; and social innovation as institutional change. She then considers some of the current issues confronting social innovation in practice and the challenges for organizations in 'doing good' and 'being good'. This generative introduction is targeted at graduate and doctoral students, as well as non-specialist academics. It aims to stimulate further discussion and analysis by providing a comprehensive understanding of social innovation and a choice of frameworks when examining complex and wicked problems and the organization and management of efforts to solve them"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSocial change. 0aProgress. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786436887 (hardback) 0aElgar introductions to management and organization theory.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786436887/9781786436887.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864368947 a10.4337/97817864368942doi05194nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245008200206264004900288300004000337336002600377337002600403338003600429490005700465504005100522505251900573520129803092588003904390650006204429650005004491655002204541700002604563710004104589776002904630856007604659856004204735024003104777eep9781786437105UtOrBLW20190718115532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190403s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781786437105 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD62.4b.R47 201900aResearch handbook of international talent management /cedited by Yipeng Liu. 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (xxv, 461 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aResearch handbooks in business and management series  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Forewords / Sir Cary L.

Despite this, however, research into talent management tends to lack theoretical underpinnings, especially from an international, multidisciplinary, and comparative perspective. This Research Handbook fills this gap, bringing together a range of leading researchers, scholars, and thinkers to debate and advance the conceptualization and understanding of this multifaceted subject. With chapters covering key topics within multiple domains of management and organization studies, the Research Handbook of International Talent Management explores the topic in innovative entrepreneurial enterprises to international businesses. It also examines how talent management relates to sustainability and public management, providing in depth coverage of the field for an interdisciplinary approach to what is one of the grand contemporary challenges facing the global economy today. This Research Handbook will be a vital resource for students of human resources management, business studies and public management policy, as well as for researchers with an interest in talent management, international management, and entrepreneurship and innovation.  aDescription based on print record. 0aIndustrial managementxResearchvHandbooks, manuals, etc. 0aInternational business enterprisesxResearch. 0aElectronic books.1 aLiu, Yipeng,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786437099 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786437099/9781786437099.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864371057 a10.4337/97817864371052doi06114nam a22003731i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040004000144050002200184245021500206264006200421300004000483336002600523337002600549338003600575490005700611504005100668505339900719520126004118650003505378655002205413700003305435700002605468700002705494710004105521776002905562856007605591856004205667024003105709eep9781786439758UtOrBLW20190718115532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190709s2019    enk     ob    001 0 eng d  a9781786439758 (e-book)  aUtOrBLWbengerdacUtOrBLWdUtOrBLW 4aHD2745b.R47 201900aResearch handbook on boards of directors /cedited by Jonas Gabrielsson (professor, Halmstad University, Sweden), Wafa Khlif (Toulouse Business School, Spain), and Sibel Yamak (University of Wolverhampton, UK). 1aCheltenham, UK :bEdward Elgar Publishing Limited,c2019.  a1 online resource (xvi, 472 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aResearch handbooks in business and management series  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Introduction -- 1.

This Research Handbook provides inspiration for researchers and practitioners interested in the manifold dimensions and facets of context surrounding boards of directors. The contributions identify the complexity and multiplicity of contexts in which boards of directors work and operate, as well as indicating how board members interact with, and influence their contexts. The chapters explore national and institutional differences, divergent understandings of board requirements, climate change and boards' duties, transformation due to digitalisation, family firms, and micro-contextual dynamics affecting boards and their decisions. This Research Handbook promotes board accountability, questions the relative position of companies in society, and reconsiders governance from a multiple context, multi-actor perspective. Building a greater understanding of the main issues and theories surrounding boards of directors, this Research Handbook will be ideal for students and scholars of business and governance. Practitioners and policy makers can also find material for their evolving frameworks. 0aBoards of directorsxResearch. 0aElectronic books.1 aGabrielsson, Jonas,eeditor.1 aKhlif, Wafa,eeditor.1 aYamak, Sibel,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786439741 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786439741/9781786439741.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864397587 a10.4337/97817864397582doi04244nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245011300206264004900319300004100368336002600409337002600435338003600461490005700497504005100554505161400605520122102219588003903440650002903479655002203508700003203530700003803562700002703600710004103627776002903668856007603697856004203773024003103815eep9781788117210UtOrBLW20190718115532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190109s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788117210 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHG4751b.H36 201900aHandbook of research on crowdfunding /cedited by Hans Landström, Annaleena Parhankangas, and Colin Mason. 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (viii, 405 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aResearch handbooks in business and management series  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: 1.

Crowdfunding is at the forefront of this movement. While research in this area has increased significantly, it is heavily fragmented. Reflecting on this, the Handbook of Research on Crowdfunding reviews and synthesizes current knowledge on crowdfunding finance and provides an agenda for further research. This Handbook covers the role of crowdfunding and the platforms used, as well as discussing the characteristics of crowdfunders themselves and the businesses that seek finance from the 'crowd'. It also investigates the process once crowdfunding is complete, and how it is used by non-profit, social and creative ventures as well as for-profit businesses. Potential negative aspects are also discussed, including inequality, risk, fraud and regulation. Finally, the future of crowdfunding, including new finance models, is outlined. Bringing together a wealth of previously fragmented knowledge, this Handbook is a key reference for all entrepreneurial finance researchers as well as those interested in the effects of crowdfunding more generally across entrepreneurship, innovation, management and economics.  aDescription based on print record. 0aCrowd fundingxResearch. 0aElectronic books.1 aLandström, Hans,eeditor.1 aParhankangas, Annaleena,eeditor.1 aMason, Colin,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788117203 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788117203/9781788117203.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881172107 a10.4337/97817881172102doi06443nam a22003615i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184100003300205245005500238264004900293300004000342336002600382337002600408338003600434504004100470505422900511520106004740588003905800650002205839655002205861710004105883776002905924856005505953856004206008024003106050eep9781788119474UtOrBLW20190718115532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190405s2019    mau     ob    000 0 eng    a9781788119474 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB615b.W45 20191 aWelter, Friederike,eauthor.10aEntrepreneurship and context /cFriederike Welter. 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (xxxi, 389 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references.0 aContents: Introduction: Friederike Welter -- 1.

The book gives a differentiated understanding of entrepreneurship and contexts, celebrating diversity as well as complexity. The author discusses temporal and spatial contexts and the role of gender for contextualising entrepreneurship, drawing attention to the interplay between history, place, gender alongside the context of researchers and entrepreneurs. Diversity is also highlighted through this contextual approach. This book offers a valuable collection of articles that provide entrepreneurship scholars with a sound basis for further research on entrepreneurship and context. Essential for those interested in exploring the foundations of the entrepreneurship and context theme, Friederike Welter's set of articles highlight the development of this debate. This will be an ideal read for all entrepreneurship scholars and students looking for an accessible review of the topic.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEntrepreneurship. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788119467 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788119467.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881194747 a10.4337/97817881194742doi05219nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184245009700204264004900301300004100350336002600391337002600417338003600443490002700479504005100506505204300557520181502600588003904415650003904454655002204493700002904515700003004544710004104574776002904615830002804644856007604672856004204748024003104790eep9781788972321UtOrBLW20190718115532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190405s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788972321 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD60b.R47 201902aA research agenda for social entrepreneurship /cedited by Anne de Bruin and Simon Teasdale. 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (xiii, 183 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aElgar research agendas  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: 1.

Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. In the last two decades social entrepreneurship has grown in energy and impact as entrepreneurial spirit has increasingly turned to finding solutions for social, cultural and environmental issues. As social entrepreneurship has grown in popularity, so too has its academic study. A Research Agenda for Social Entrepreneurship brings together contributions from developing paths in the field to signpost the directions ahead for the study of social entrepreneurship. Moving beyond mainstream approaches to entrepreneurship, this innovative and insightful book offers a unique view into the contemporary state of social entrepreneurship research. Impressive and diverse, this book explores not only established research, but also draws out implications for social entrepreneurship from legal scholarship, gender studies and indigenous research, as well as investigating regional contexts. Moreover, the contributors take inspiration from emerging societal trends, such as the circular economy and the turn of entrepreneurship to ecology and the environment. Featuring diverse insights from different disciplinary and geographical perspectives, this book is invaluable to students of social entrepreneurship at all levels who are in need of a broad and cutting-edge overview of the topics. Researchers seeking original research topics and questions will benefit from this book's insight into the future of the subject. The accessible style will also serve social entrepreneurs themselves, offering a fascinating exploration of the many pathways for social entrepreneurship.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSocial entrepreneurshipxResearch. 0aElectronic books.1 aDe Bruin, Anne,eeditor.1 aTeasdale, Simon,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788972314 (hardback) 0aElgar research agendas.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788972314/9781788972314.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889723217 a10.4337/97817889723212doi03285nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002700184100003100211245013700242264004900379300003800428336002600466337002600492338003600518490004600554504005100600505052400651520140201175588003902577650002302616655002202639710004102661776002902702830004002731856005502771856004202826024003102868eep9781788972598UtOrBLW20190718115532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190405s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788972598 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF5549.5.S45bB44 20191 aBeggan, James K.,eauthor.10aSexual harassment, the abuse of power and the crisis of leadership :b"superstar" harassers and how to stop them /cJames K.

Sexual harassment and the future: Where do we go from here? -- Index.  aWithin these pages James K. Beggan puts forward a novel approach to understanding sexual harassment by high value superstars in the workplace. The approach integrates ideas derived from evolutionary theory, utility theory, sexual scripting theory and research on the regulation of emotion. Besides providing a better understanding of the phenomenon, the book aims to contribute to the development of better techniques to prevent sexual harassment.  Recently, credible allegations of sexual misconduct against high profile figures have dominated the news. Sexual harassment has become an important issue for leaders and those who study leadership. The author presents a new approach to understanding sexual harassment in the #MeToo era that integrates research from a diverse range of areas typically ignored by researchers on sexual harassment. Ideas derived from this new approach are used to propose more effective methods for the elimination of sexual harassment in the workplace. The book also addresses how efforts to prevent sexual harassment may interfere with the free expression of sexuality and ultimately threaten the rights of the individual.  Academics and journalists interested in understanding sexual harassment, including graduate students, and undergraduates enrolled in upper division specialized courses in gender relations will find this book to be innovative and informative.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSexual harassment. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788972581 (hardback) 0aNew horizons in leadership studies.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788972581.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889725987 a10.4337/97817889725982doi02923nam a22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184100003100206245008600237250002000323264004900343300005500392336002600447337002600473338003600499504005100535505043900586520121201025588003902237650003902276655002202315710004102337776002902378856006902407856004202476024003102518eep9781788973564UtOrBLW20190718115532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190405s2019    maua    ob    001 0 eng    a9781788973564 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD30.4b.G44 20191 aGherardi, Silvia,eauthor.10aHow to conduct a practice-based study :bproblems and methods /cSilvia Gherardi.  aSecond edition. 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (xi, 302 pages) :billustrations  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Introduction -- 1.

Practice-based approaches to knowing, learning, innovating, and managing have thrived in recent years. Calling upon numerous narratives from a range of research fields, the author offers insight into the many possibilities of practice research, highlighting the inextricable links between humans and technology as the key emergent trend in management studies. Developing an innovative posthumanist approach, this novel book offers a useful and insightful compass for the navigation of practice-based studies through the lens of exemplar vignettes from internationally acclaimed researchers. A valuable and instructive work, this book is critical to any scholars of practice theories, as well as management and organizational studies and those with a keen interest in research methods. Masters students seeking insight into the development of practice-based studies, and PhD researchers developing their own methodologies will also find the guidance of this book indispensable in their studies.  aDescription based on print record. 0aManagementxResearchxMethodology. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788973557 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788973557/9781788973557.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889735647 a10.4337/97817889735642doi04787nam a22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002500184245013700209264004900346300005600395336002600451337002600477338003600503490004900539504005100588505200700639520123502646588003903881650004303920650003703963650003104000655002204031700003304053700003104086700002904117710004104146776002904187856007604216856004204292024003104334eep9781788975063UtOrBLW20190718115532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190405s2019    maua    ob    001 0 eng    a9781788975063 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aRA418.5.M4bR47 201900aResponsible innovation in digital health :bempowering the patient /cedited by Tatiana Iakovleva, Elin M.

The form of digital healthcare - a suite of new technologies offering significant benefits in cost and quality - allow institutions to keep pace with society's needs. This book covers the need for responsible innovation in this area, exploring the issues of implementation as well as potential negative consequences to ensure digital healthcare delivers for the benefit of all stakeholders. This book offers a considered view on what a responsible innovation process might involve and how this will enable multiple stakeholders - users, medics, businesses and policymakers - to create a system of delivering better care at lower costs. Illustrated by international case studies, the contributing authors explore the dimensions of responsible innovation with patient engagement and the ways in which this can lead to better design, enhanced diffusion of knowledge and improvement in healthcare. A much-needed exploration of the role of innovation in healthcare with patients in mind, this book will be essential for academics in innovation, ethics, social entrepreneurship and healthcare studies.  aDescription based on print record. 0aTechnological innovationsxManagement. 0aMedical innovationsxManagement. 0aCommunication in medicine. 0aElectronic books.1 aIakovleva, Tatiana,eeditor.1 aOftedal, Elin M.,eeditor.1 aBessant, J.

With 27 contributions from 57 expert scholars, this Handbook highlights both emerging practices and scalable solutions. Acting as a call to action, the chapters place social impact at the heart of theory and practice, providing fresh insight into global issues and practical solutions. Organized into five distinct sections to reflect current theoretical approaches and frameworks, contributions cover social innovation in practice; community and place; systems, institutions and infrastructure; individuals, organizations and organizing, and networks and social change. This Handbook emphasizes the fundamental shift needed in management scholarship to address global problems and achieve social impact by working towards the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. This will be an invaluable resource for those championing social inclusion in both research and practice, including innovation researchers and management scholars more broadly.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSocial changexEconomic aspects. 0aSocial changexEnvironmental aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aGeorge, Gerard,eeditor.1 aBaker, Ted,eeditor.1 aTracey, Paul,eeditor.1 aJoshi, Havovi,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786436009 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786436009/9781786436009.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864360167 a10.4337/97817864360162doi05011nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245031100206264004900517300003500566336002600601337002600627338003600653490002900689500002000718505235000738520108203088588003904170650002704209655002204236700003204258700003204290700003004322710004104352776002904393830003004422856007604452856004204528024003104570eep9781788116954UtOrBLW20190610095539.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190110s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788116954 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD58.8b.P74 201900aPreparing for high impact organizational change :bexperiential learning and practice /cedited by Gavin M.

Tested high-impact exercises in the book will prepare change leaders at all organizational levels to deal with the myriad of challenges inherent in the process of organizational change. Effective organizational change involves a combination of understanding, learning and unlearning, and practiced behaviour as part of the underlying conceptualization, formulation, and implementation processes. The book presents a series of exercises that promote self-learning and developing readiness for change, from preparing people for change, understanding and managing resistance, and coping with change-related obstacles to seeking buy-in for the change. Emphasis throughout the book is placed on developing change-related competencies. This book is a resource for understanding aspects of change, from theory to practice, for consultants, educators, students and practitioners in corporate training and development roles.  aDescription based on print record. 0aOrganizational change. 0aElectronic books.1 aSchwarz, Gavin M.,eeditor.1 aBuono, Anthony F.,eeditor.1 aAdams, Susan M.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788116947 (hardback) 0aElgar guides to teaching.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788116947/9781788116947.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881169547 a10.4337/97817881169542doi03095nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184100003300204245023800237264004900475300003400524336002600558337002600584338003600610500002000646504004100666505029500707520131601002588003902318650002402357650002702381650002802408655002202436700002902458710004102487776002902528856005502557856004202612024003102654eep9781788970044UtOrBLW20190610095539.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190225s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788970044 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aB842b.H36 20191 aHansen, Anne Vorre,eauthor.10aTheorizing in organization studies :binsights from key thinkers /cAnne Vorre Hansen (Department of Social Sciences and Business, Roskilde University) and Sabine Madsen (Department of Political Science, Aalborg University, Denmark). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (144 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.  aIncludes bibliographical references.0 aContents: Foreword by Richard Swedberg -- 1.

The aim of this book is to encourage researchers to reflect upon their subjective theorizing practices and to engage in dialogue about theorizing in organization studies. Drawing on interviews with eight key figures in the field, this book provides guidance for how to theorize, and how to do so well, using the key tools of the theorizers. Providing rich insights, these interviews with Professors David Boje, Barbara Czarniawska, Kenneth Gergen, Tor Hernes, Geert Hofstede, Edgar Schein, Andrew Van de Ven and Karl Weick give an opportunity to learn from some of the most successful theorists in the field of organization studies. By addressing aspects of theorizing which seek to make it a personal and meaningful endeavour, this book goes beyond the sole aim of getting published and encourages readers to develop their own unique way of theorizing. This book will be an invaluable tool for graduate researchers and scholars looking to refine their theorizing practices in order to produce outstanding theoretical work. Its insights will also be of use to anyone seeking to breathe new life into their work, with its insightful commentary on the practices of successful theorists.  aDescription based on print record. 0aTheory (Philosophy) 0aResearchxMethodology. 0aOrganizationxResearch. 0aElectronic books.1 aMadsen, Sabine,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788970037 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788970037.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889700447 a10.4337/97817889700442doi03426nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002400184100003300208245021700241264004900458300003400507336002600541337002600567338003600593500002000629504004100649505079700690520123101487588003902718650002502757650003802782655002202820710004102842776002902883856005502912856004202967024003103009eep9781789900934UtOrBLW20190610095539.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190225s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781789900934 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHV8079.F7bG68 20191 aGottschalk, Petter,eauthor.10aConvenience triangle in white-collar crime :bcase studies of fraud examinations /cPetter Gottschalk (Professor, Department of Leadership and Organizational Behavior, BI Norwegian Business School, Oslo, Norway). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (304 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.  aIncludes bibliographical references.0 aContents: Introduction -- 1.

This book aims to discuss the role of the 'convenience triangle' in white-collar crime, how it affects the perpetration of these crimes, the impact of this on detection and prevention and the effects of the punitive measures taken against white-collar criminals. The 'convenience triangle' is the dynamic relationship between motive, opportunity, and willingness to commit a crime, which culminates in the illegal acts that constitute white-collar crime. The relationship between these factors is explored through case studies highlighting each of these six causal relationships. Alongside this, the role of whistleblowing in the detection of white-collar crime, and the issue of incarceration for white collar criminals are discussed. For students of business and management, this book will provide valuable insights into the motivation and practice of white-collar crime. Its insights and discussion will also prove valuable for practitioners, engaged in both management and crime prevention.  aDescription based on print record. 0aFraud investigation. 0aWhite collar crime investigation. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781789900927 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781789900927.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817899009347 a10.4337/97817899009342doi06116nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245013500206264004900341300003500390336002600425337002600451338003600477490005000513500002000563505351700583520127804100588003905378650002405417650001905441655002205460700002905482710004105511776002905552856007605581856004205657024003105699eep9781786434272UtOrBLW20190314093534.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181031s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786434272 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD38.5b.H36 201900aHandbook on the sustainable supply chain /cedited by Joseph Sarkis (Foisie Business School, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, US). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (616 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aResearch handbooks in business and management  aIncludes index.0 aContents: 1.

The chapters in this volume view this social value from a program evaluation perspective, and the focus of the evaluations is the generation of new technology funded by public sector agencies. Through keen and approachable analysis, the authors provide important background on both methodology and application. Link and Scott have assembled a collection of their seminal works on the social value of new technology. The first paper provides a general, hands-on overview of the theory and practice of program evaluation, while remaining chapters go on to focus on a number of public sector programs ranging from the U.S. Department of Defense Small Business Innovation Research program to Canada's programs to support the development of medical imaging technology. The authors demonstrate that this area of research is relevant not only to established scholars and practitioners, but also to students. This book will serve as a valuable resource to academic researchers and graduate students in public administration, public policy, and economics, as well as practitioners in the evaluation field.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSocial values. 0aTechnological innovations. 0aElectronic books.1 aLink, Albert N.,eeditor.1 aScott, John T.,d1947-eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788116329 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788116329/9781788116329.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881163367 a10.4337/97817881163362doi02687nam a22003615i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184100003400205245012100239264004900360300003400409336002600443337002600469338003600495504005100531505054000582520090201122588003902024650004202063655002202105710004102127776002902168856005502197856004202252024003102294eep9781788116411UtOrBLW20190314093535.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181213s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788116411 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB615b.J66 20191 aJones, Colin,d1966-eauthor.10aHow to teach entrepreneurship /cColin Jones (School of Management, Queensland University of Technology, Australia). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (232 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Foreword by Andy Penaluna -- Introduction -- Part I The players -- 1.

This important book provides many of the answers to this challenging question. In developing the first signature pedagogy for entrepreneurship education, Colin Jones unites the contexts of enterprise and education at the intersection of scholarship, transformational learning and student engagement. Good teaching for entrepreneurship is shown to emerge both from the educator and the students' interest. For the educator, a process of scholarly leading is required to support student interest - from the alternate perspective, students require a willingness to welcome uncertainty and challenge the existing boundaries to effectively develop a capacity for self-negotiated action. A key guide for all entrepreneurship lecturers and tutors, written for all teaching contexts, this book will challenge you to teach 'who you are', as well as what you know.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEntrepreneurshipxStudy and teaching. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788116404 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788116404.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881164117 a10.4337/97817881164112doi05602nam a22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245042000205264004900625300003500674336002600709337002600735338003600761490003700797500002000834505271300854520113803567588003904705650004204744650003104786655002204817700002904839700002704868700002804895710004104923776002904964830003804993856007605031856004205107024003105149eep9781786438232UtOrBLW20190515122541.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181219s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786438232 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB615b.R65 201904aThe role and impact of entrepreneurship education :bmethods, teachers and innovative programmes /cedited by Alain Fayolle (Distinguished Professor of Entrepreneurship and Director, Entrepreneurship Research Centre, EMLYON Business School, Ecully, France), Dafna Kariv (Professor of Entrepreneurship and Vice President, COLLMAN, Rishon LeZion, Israel), and Harry Matlay (Global Independent Research, Coventry, UK). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (384 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aNew horizons in entrepreneurship  aIncludes index.0 aContents: 1.

Although the psychological contract has been explored extensively over the last 50 years, numerous theoretical, conceptual, empirical, methodological, and analytical changes have pushed the field forward. As such, it is time to take stock and move forward. The contributors to this Handbook explore in detail this important component of modern management thinking. This volume's objective is to challenge and refine the way scholars think about the psychological contract in the workplace by evaluating current assumptions embedded in psychological contract research, proposing new conceptual and theoretical developments, introducing dynamic psychological contract processes and offering new methodological and analytical developments. It concludes with a chapter, by leading researchers, outlining a proposed research agenda to further our understanding going forward. Academic audiences - faculty, graduate students - and others working in organizational behaviour and industrial and organizational psychology will value the theoretical aspects of this study as well as the new and exciting methodological propositions and elaborations. And evidence-based management practitioners will find interest in the chapters dealing with psychological contract breach and overcoming the aftermath of breach perceptions as they may inform policy and interventions.  aDescription based on print record. 0aManagementxPsychological aspects. 0aCorporate culture. 0aElectronic books.1 aGriep, Yannick,eeditor.1 aCooper, Cary,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788115674 (hardback) 0aNew horizons in management.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788115674/9781788115674.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881156817 a10.4337/97817881156812doi04967nam a22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245042200205264004900627300003500676336002600711337002600737338003600763490002700799500002000826505155200846520169602398588003904094650002204133650002604155655002204181700003404203700003104237700003004268710004104298776002904339830002804368856007604396856004204472024003104514eep9781788116015UtOrBLW20190515122541.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190109s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788116015 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB615b.R47 201902aA research agenda for entrepreneurship and innovation /cedited by David B.

Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. Within the span of a generation, innovation and entrepreneurship have emerged as two of the most vital forces in the economy and in society. This Research Agenda highlights new insights and approaches to guide future thinking, research and policy in the area. To accomplish this, the editors have brought together a group of accomplished scholars spanning economics, management, public policy and finance. Drawing on the experiences and insights of leading scholars this Research Agenda covers a broad array of rich and promising topics, including entrepreneurial ecosystems, finance and the role of universities. Focusing on the intersection and overlap between the two disciplines, the Research Agenda begins by establishing the theoretical basis between the two topics, before exploring impact, context, academic entrepreneurship, start-ups, policy and corporate governance. The book concludes with three provocative chapters: Friederike Welter highlighting the power of words and images, Sameeksha Desai discussing the role of artificial intelligence and Mark Casson presenting a case for radical change to how entrepreneurship is studied. Presenting the most salient findings and themes in current literature, A Research Agenda for Entrepreneurship and Innovation is essential for researchers in innovation, as well as policy makers at both the local and national levels influenced by the increasing importance of entrepreneurship and innovation.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEntrepreneurship. 0aCorporate governance. 0aElectronic books.1 aAudretsch, David B.,eeditor.1 aLehmann, Erik E.,eeditor.1 aLink, Albert N.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788116008 (hardback) 0aElgar research agendas.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788116008/9781788116008.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881160157 a10.4337/97817881160152doi02986nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184100003300206245024700239264004900486300003500535336002600570337002600596338003600622490007500658504005100733505053700784520096501321588003902286650002602325650002902351655002202380710004102402776002902443856005502472856004202527024003102569eep9781788977913UtOrBLW20190515122541.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190225s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788977913 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF5549b.T56 20191 aTimming, Andrew R.,eauthor.10aHuman resource management and evolutionary psychology :bexploring the biological foundations of managing people at work /cAndrew R.

In this innovative book, culture and language are analysed in terms of how they affect employee relations internationally, demonstrating the importance of recognising and understanding these elements in the face of increasing globalisation. International Comparative Employee Relations first examines the subject from a broader international perspective, discussing the impact of cultural context on common areas such as labour law and collective bargaining, and exploring the issues of translating these concepts, as well as surveying current scholarship in the field. In later chapters, case studies from China, Italy, Germany, the USA and Nigeria provide specific examples of the cultural and linguistic complexity and diversity of employee relations both within and between nations. Scholars and students of international business management, particularly those with an interest in comparative employment relations or comparative human resource management, will find this book insightful.

Practical cases from several organizations, as well as popular theories such as the Resource-Based Theory and Institutional Theory provide for an insightful yet realistic understanding of OPM as an integrative tool for organizations to improve their efficiency and effectiveness. The reader will learn how separate organizational functions, such as project, program and portfolio management and governance integrate in a cohesive manner. The authors describe how different approaches to competing in the marketplace link to strategies, and the ways of selecting the 'best' business opportunities for organizations and integrating them into existing workflows and structures.

Chapters provide a wide range of differing theoretical approaches with which to explore the legal, economic and socio-political aspects of labour, work and employment in pre-capitalist, capitalist and post-capitalist societies. The Handbook explores the purpose, roles, rights and powers of employers and management, workers and unions, states and governments in the age of globalised neo-liberalism. Different non-standard and non-renumerated types of work are examined with their counterparts, offering a thorough insight into the modern economy with a key focus on migration, gender, race and community. An essential reference for political economists as well as business and management scholars, this comprehensive Handbook provides an important analysis of the interconnectedness of politics and labour, work and employment. This will also be a useful read for policy makers looking for broad insights to the ways in which policies can impact labour, work and employment"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aIndustrial relations. 0aPersonnel management. 0aLabor laws and legislation. 0aElectronic books.1 aGall, Gregor,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781784715687 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781784715687/9781784715687.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817847156947 a10.4337/97817847156942doi04020nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245014500206264005100351300003500402336002600437337002600463338003600489490002700525504005100552505122000603520134401823588003903167650004203206655002203248700003003270700002903300700003403329710004103363776002903404830002803433856007603461856004203537024003103579eep9781788114363UtOrBLW20191022091542.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190919s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788114363 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aGT3405b.R47 201902aA research agenda for event management /cEdited by John Armbrecht, Erik Lundberg and Tommy D.

Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. Offering a unique collection of established and emerging perspectives on event management, this Research Agenda investigates contemporary themes and innovative methodologies. 10 chapters cover core topics in the current academic debate, exploring the development of event management from a management-oriented field into a multidisciplinary research area. Organised into three parts, the Research Agenda contains international contributions from academics across tourism, geography, management, psychology and sociology fields. Initially tackling events in society, the book moves on to look specifically at the consumer, and finally examines the event organization. Chapters recommend the integration of events in geographical and political contexts, suggesting research agendas for the future that focus on the spectator, the participant and, ultimately, the consumer. Critical reading for management and tourism scholars, this book offers key insights to developing topics in the field. Event practitioners and policy makers will also greatly benefit from reading this"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSpecial eventsxManagementxResearch. 0aElectronic books.1 aArmbrecht, John,eeditor.1 aLundberg, Erik,eeditor.1 aAndersson, Tommy D.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788114356 (hardback) 0aElgar research agendas.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788114356/9781788114356.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881143637 a10.4337/97817881143632doi05272nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245031300206264005100519300003400570336002600604337002600630338003600656504005100692505248700743520126203230588003904492650002404531650002304555655002204578700003104600700003604631710004104667776002904708856007604737856004204813024003104855eep9781788118095UtOrBLW20191022091543.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190724s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788118095 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD7261b.I53 201900aIncreasing occupational health and safety in workplaces :bindividual, work and organizational factors /cEdited by the late Ronald J.

A further one million workers suffer workplace accidents every day. Alongside the human impact, these accidents cost an estimated 4 per cent of GDP in the US, equating to 2.8 trillion US dollars. This book considers occupational health and safety, and the ways in which it can be increased to both improve working conditions and reduce the material costs of accidents. Bringing together leading academics in the field, and presenting original research from both the private and public sectors, Increasing Occupational Health and Safety in Workplaces argues for greater reporting of workplace accidents and injuries. It also incorporates stress as a factor in rates of accidents and injuries, and suggests ways in which workplace safety cultures can be fostered and improved. This book will be an invaluable tool for students of management, especially those with an interest in small businesses. Its insights will also be of interest for organizational administrators responsible for workplace accidents and injuries at various levels, and for government employees with an interest in occupational health and safety"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aIndustrial hygiene. 0aIndustrial safety. 0aElectronic books.1 aBurke, Ronald J.,eeditor.1 aRichardsen, Astrid M.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788118088 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788118088/9781788118088.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881180957 a10.4337/97817881180952doi05385nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002300184245037500207264005100582300003400633336002600667337002600693338003600719504005100755505240300806520137803209588003904587650003904626655002204665700003804687700002804725700002704753710004104780776002904821856007604850856004204926024003104968eep9781788970181UtOrBLW20191022091543.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190919s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788970181 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD62.25b.F36 201900aFamily firms and institutional contexts :bbusiness models, innovation and competitive advantage /cEdited by Giorgia Maria D'Allura (Department of Economics and Business, University of Catania), Andrea Colli (Department of Social and Political Sciences, Bocconi University, Italy) and Sanjay Goel (Department of Management Studies, University of Minnesota, Duluth, US). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (352 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Introduction / Andrea Colli, Giorgia M.

This innovative book takes an interdisciplinary, cross-national approach to the study of family firms as institutions as well as the relationship between family firms and external institutions. In doing so, it demonstrates the impact of these interactions both on the firms and institutions themselves and on the wider economic context. Featuring in-depth analysis of original research, chapters take both theoretical and empirical approaches to explore the family firm as an organization, and include several key case studies. At a micro level, the social and cultural unit of the family and its behaviour is investigated, and at a macro level, external institutional contexts are examined to explain and theorise firms' behaviours and strategies, covering areas such as innovation, competitiveness and reputation. The book provides important conceptual insights and critical empirical research, as well as ideas for future research agendas. Family Firms and Institutional Contexts will be a critical read for scholars and doctoral students in business and management, particularly those with an interest in family firms. Policymakers and practitioners in these areas will also find its insights of practical relevance"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aFamily-owned business enterprises. 0aElectronic books.1 aD'Allura, Giorgia Maria,eeditor.1 aColli, Andrea,eeditor.1 aGoel, Sanjay,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788970174 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788970174/9781788970174.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889701817 a10.4337/97817889701812doi06032nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245032400206264005100530300003400581336002600615337002600641338003600667504005100703505317200754520125103926588003905177650002405216650002305240655002205263700002905285700003205314700002805346700002905374710004105403776002905444856007605473856004205549024003105591eep9781788975087UtOrBLW20191022091543.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190907s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788975087 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF1106b.L43 201900aLearning and teaching in higher education :bperspectives from a business school /cEdited by Kathy Daniels (Associate Dean, Learning and Teaching), Caroline Elliott (Deputy Dean), Simon Finley (Associate Dean, Learning and Teaching) and Colin Chapman (Associate Dean, Learning and Teaching, Aston Business School, UK). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (360 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Preface -- Foreword -- Introduction -- 1.

This invaluable book comprehensively addresses this issue, providing an overview of teaching in a business school that covers all stages of student learning. This book demonstrates various ways to engage students and offers techniques to enhance teaching practice, focusing on particular challenges such as large group teaching, increasing attendance and engagement, and successful professional development. All the contributors have current experience of teaching in a business school, allowing them to offer honest, personal assessments of what is effective in practice. Chapters address specific topics such as technology enhanced learning, while useful 'thoughts' provide creative and innovative suggestions on improving participation and outcomes. Learning and Teaching in Higher Education will be an important resource for those teaching in a business school setting, as well as having significant value to anyone teaching in higher education more generally"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aBusiness education. 0aEducation, Higher. 0aElectronic books.1 aDaniels, Kathy,eeditor.1 aElliott, Caroline,eeditor.1 aFinley, Simon,eeditor.1 aChapman, Colin,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788975070 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788975070/9781788975070.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889750877 a10.4337/97817889750872doi04904nam a22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002100196245048200217264005100699300003500750336002600785337002600811338003600837490004300873504005100916505179100967520128602758588003904044650004004083655002204123700002804145700003204173700002604205700003204231710004104263776002904304856007604333856004204409024003104451eep9781789903980UtOrBLW20191022091543.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190808s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781789903980 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  ae------ 4aHB615b.R54 201900aRigour and relevance in entrepreneurship research, resources and outcomes :bfrontiers in European entrepreneurship research /cEdited by Eddy Laveren (Professor, University of Antwerp and Antwerp Management School, Belgium), Robert Blackburn (Professor, Small Business Research Centre, Kingston University, UK), Ulla Hytti (Research Director, University of Turku, Finland) and Hans Landström (Professor, Sten K.

This Handbook explores the nature and direction of the sharing economy, interrogating its key dynamics and evolution over the past decade and critiquing its effect on society. Using an interdisciplinary perspective, this Handbook analyses labour, governance, trust and consumption in the contemporary sharing economy. It questions the apparent contradiction between its components: the moral economy of small-scale communal sharing versus the far-flung reaches of the market economy. Chapters explore ways to resolve this paradox, theorizing hybrid economic forms and considering the replacement of human trust inherent in the sharing economy with a transactional reputation economy. Featuring a variety of both conceptual explorations and empirical investigations in a variety of different cross-cultural contexts, this Handbook illustrates how and, more importantly, why the sharing economy has reshaped marketplaces, and will continue to disrupt them as it develops. Written in an accessible style, this thorough Handbook offers crucial insights for researchers across a variety of disciplines interested in the trajectories of modern consumption, as well as students studying the sharing economy. Practitioners, policy makers and public speakers working in and around the sharing economy will also benefit from this book's unique analysis of trends in consumer economics"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aCooperationvHandbooks, manuals, etc. 0aElectronic books.1 aBelk, Russell W.,eeditor.1 aEckhardt, Giana M.,eeditor.1 aBardhi, Fleura,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788110532 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788110532/9781788110532.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881105497 a10.4337/97817881105492doi05300nam a22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002300184245029200207250001900499264005100518300003400569336002600603337002600629338003600655504005100691505237500742520127003117588003904387650004404426650004304470650002204513655002204535700003504557700003704592700003004629710004104659776002904700856007604729856004204805024003104847eep9781786439079UtOrBLW20190912111033.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190724s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781786439079 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD62.37b.H36 201900aHandbook of research on techno-entrepreneurship :becosystems, innovation and development /cEdited by François Thérin (Taylor's University, Malaysia), Francesco Paolo Appio (SKEMA Business School, Université Côte d'Azur, France) and Hyungseok Yoon (The University of Leeds, UK).  aThird edition. 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (400 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Part I -- Conceptualisation 1.

This Handbook explores the new theoretical frameworks that are needed to cope with the growing relevance of techno-entrepreneurship initiatives globally. Demonstrating that techno-entrepreneurship and its ecosystems create opportunities across national borders, this Handbook also shows how they proactively shape their business environment and engage in more complex collaborative networks. Chapters cover emerging areas in the field, such as frugal innovation, the drone industry and gender-specific entrepreneurship. Separated into sections dedicated to entrepreneurial ecosystems - with original research into incubators, accelerators and crowd funding - and techno-entrepreneurship across countries, the contributors examine specific issues that arise in context. With international scope, this Handbook will be an essential read for entrepreneurship and innovation scholars.

Leading scholars in the field explore theories in the context of contemporary debates concerning policies that affect and regulate work and the management of employment, as well as the activities and experiences of actors within the employment relationship. The book is divided into three sections to capture different theoretical lenses used to reflect on HRM and ER concerns about work: systems and historical development; institutions; and people and processes. Expert contributors have drawn on extensive research experience to present a contemporary understanding of a range of theories, how they evolved, and how they might be used in the future. Essential reading for HRM, ER and management scholars and research students, this book challenges readers to reassess their thinking about the significance of theory in research and practice"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aPersonnel management. 0aSupervision of employees. 0aElectronic books.1 aTownsend, Keith,eeditor.1 aCafferkey, Kenneth,eeditor.1 aMcDermott, Aoife,eeditor.1 aDundon, Tony,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786439000 (hardback) 0aElgar introductions to management and organization theory.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786439000/9781786439000.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864390177 a10.4337/97817864390172doi05826nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002700184245019700211264005100408300003500459336002600494337002600520338003600546490005500582504005100637505311800688520124203806588003905048650002205087650002105109650002605130655002205156700003105178710004105209776002905250856007605279856004205355024003105397eep9781788118774UtOrBLW20190912111033.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190729s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788118774 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF5549.5.J63bH36 201900aHandbook of research methods on the quality of working lives /cEdited by Daniel Wheatley (Senior Lecturer, Department of Management, Birmingham Business School, University of Birmingham, UK). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (352 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aHandbooks of Research Methods in Management series  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: 1 Introduction: Researching the quality of working / Lives Daniel Wheatley -- Part I: Researching the quality of working lives: Philosophical, conceptual and practical considerations 2.

This Handbook provides critical reflections on recent research in the field, including examining the inextricable links between working life and well-being. The Handbook offers comprehensive support to researchers working in quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods traditions. Drawing from an international evidence base, the contributors use examples of research into key contemporary issues such as the gendered nature of work, skills mismatch, job insecurity, work-life balance, flexibility, the gig-economy and the physical work environment. Chapters explore how research methods have been used to investigate aspects of both paid and unpaid work, raising further questions and highlighting limitations. The Handbook of Research Methods on the Quality of Working Lives is an essential resource for all those involved in areas that study, or touch on, the quality of working lives. It will benefit both new and experienced researchers inside and outside academia and across disciplines such as economics, human resource management, psychology and social policy"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aJob satisfaction. 0aEmployee morale. 0aPersonnel management. 0aElectronic books.1 aWheatley, Daniel,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788118767 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788118767/9781788118767.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881187747 a10.4337/97817881187742doi04087nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002800117040003200145042000800177050002200185245016400207264004900371300003500420336002600455337002600481338003600507490002700543500002000570505137300590520131801963588003903281650003803320655002203358700003103380700003003411710004103441776003003482830002803512856007603540856004203616024003103658eep9781788116060UtOrBLW20190412114035.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181218s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788116060q(e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB74.P8bR47 201902aA research agenda for economic psychology /cedited by Katharina Gangl (University of Goettingen, Germany), and Erich Kirchler (University of Vienna, Austria). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (232 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aElgar research agendas  aIncludes index.0 aContents: 1.

This updated and revised edition of The Handbook of Globalisation offers novel insights into the rapid changes our world is facing, and how best we can handle them. With multi-disciplinary contributions from leading experts, this Handbook covers a broad spectrum of issues and opportunities surrounding modern globalisation. It explores the idea that globalisation is not new, natural or inevitable, but rather that current global arrangements are the result of corporate pressure and the choices of politicians. It highlights the fact that the deregulated, free market form of globalisation is not unavoidable and explores a new era of global co-operation based around a Green New Deal. It also considers the future of globalisation in the face of the Trump presidency, Brexit and the move towards more state-centred policies. This Handbook continues to be a vital resource for scholars, students and researchers of economics, international relations, and business and management who wish to gain a more in-depth understanding of globalisation from a variety of different disciplines. Politicians and policy makers will also benefit from the advice offered to avoid some of the increasingly negative impacts of our globalising world.  aDescription based on print record. 0aGlobalizationxLaw and legislation. 0aElectronic books.1 aMichie, Jonathan,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788118590q(hardback)z9781788118613q(pbk.)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788118590/9781788118590.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881186067 a10.4337/97817881186062doi02885nam a22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002800117040003200145042000800177050002200185100002500207245027500232264004900507300003400556336002600590337002600616338003600642504005100678505022800729520122800957588003902185650001902224655002202243700004702265710004102312776003002353856005502383856004202438024003102480eep9781788973465UtOrBLW20190412114035.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190225s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788973465q(e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF1365b.B47 20191 aBergeijk, Peter Van.10aDeglobalization 2.0 :btrade and openness during the Great Depression and the Great Recession /cPeter A.G. van Bergeijk (Professor of International Economics and Macroeconomics, International Institute of Social Studies, Erasmus University, The Hague, the Netherlands). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (224 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Preface -- 1.

As populist agendas worldwide gain momentum, Deglobalization 2.0 explores the key drivers of reactionary movements. From the 'Make America Great Again' movement in the US, to Continental European populism, Peter van Bergeijk explains the critical catalysts of anti-globalization sentiment. Through a historical lens, this book draws out similarities and differences between contemporary developments and the economic crises of the 1930s, offering a unique understanding of the political and economic drivers of deglobalization. Focusing on wealth inequality, social uncertainty and international competition for economic supremacy, van Bergeijk examines and offers answers for the lacunae in the globalization debate. Provocative, insightful and accessible, this book confronts the deglobalization issue as a matter of real urgency and is thus vital reading for policy makers and managers working in international affairs and economic relations. It also offers guidance for academics in international economics and relations moving into the uncharted territory of deglobalization processes.  aDescription based on print record. 0aGlobalization. 0aElectronic books.1 aBergeijk, Peter A.

However, EU countries have sometimes experienced different trajectories, due in part to their different starting points and the fact that their convergence on particular socio-economic indicators has varied. At the same time, little evidence has so far been presented on cross-country convergence within the EU. This book aims to answer a number of important questions. To what extent have European countries converged or diverged with EU-wide economic and social indicators over the past 20 years? What have been the drivers of convergence? Why do some countries lag behind, while others experience continuous upward convergence? Why are these trajectories not always linear? Particular attention is paid to the role of institutions, actors and industrial relations - focusing on the resources and strategies of governments, employers and trade unions - in nudging EU countries onto an upward convergence path. This book provides a unique analysis of socio-economic indicators to identify convergence trends in the EU. It defines a number of clusters that help to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of national socio-economic models and the European Social Model. Cross-country case studies help to identify the possible impact of global movements (migration, foreign investment) and policies (social protection, social dialogue, employment) on cross-country convergence. This book offers a timely assessment of convergence within the EU, identifying its drivers in the world of work and in institutions and industrial relations. It presents examples of where institutions and industrial relations can change convergence outcomes and proposes a range of useful policy options.

Generating growth and expanding markets, it boosts productivity through the exchange of ideas, technologies, and human resources. This book explores the key vision of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): fostering the free flow of goods, services, investment, and skilled labor in order to establish a globally competitive region with a single market and production base. Bringing together contributions from renowned scholars in their respective fields, this book takes stock of the trends and patterns of skilled labor migration in the ASEAN, examining the existing literature and adding to it with unique insights drawn from original case studies and policy simulations. Identifying the challenges posed by recent significant changes, this book also looks to the future, to identify potential policy responses. The contributions dispel a common assumption that skill mobility is a zero-sum game, and instead contend that it can be mutually beneficial for both sides. With rigorous quantitative analysis this book will be a useful tool for both policy practitioners and policymakers as well as for researchers and students of international development, economics, and Asian studies"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomic developmentzSoutheast Asia. 0aSkilled laborzSoutheast Asia.20aASEAN. 0aElectronic books.1 aGentile, Elisabette,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788116169 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788116169/9781788116169.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881161767 a10.4337/97817881161762doi03311nam a22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184100002600206245026200232264005100494300003500545336002600580337002600606338003600632490006800668500002000736505041600756520127201172588003902444650002802483650002202511655002202533700003302555700002702588710004102615776002902656830006202685856006902747856004202816024003102858eep9781788975001UtOrBLW20190814141532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190710s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788975001 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHG1710b.B47 20191 aBerg, Chris,eauthor.10aUnderstanding the blockchain economy :ban introduction to institutional cryptoeconomics /cChris Berg, Sinclair Davidson and Jason Potts (RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub, School of Economics, Fincance and marketing, RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (224 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aNew horizons in institutional and evolutionary economics series  aIncludes index.0 aContents 1.

Applying the institutional economics of Ronald Coase and Oliver Williamson, the authors highlight how blockchains are poised to reshape the nature of firms, governments, markets and civil society. Chapters apply basic economic principles to explore blockchains and distributed ledger technologies through the framework of institutional economics. The book suggests ways in which cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin may develop further in the future, bringing us back to a barter economy which removes the need for a third person in economic transactions. Outlining a ledger-centric view of the economy, the authors explore how blockchains and dehierarchalisation will reduce the demand for government regulation. Institutional economists and scholars will greatly appreciate the thorough analysis of the development of institutional cryptoeconomics and insight into the future of blockchains that this book offers. Computer and technology scientists will also find this book to be a valuable read, as well as those working specifically in the blockchain industry"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aBlockchains (Databases) 0aCryptocurrencies. 0aElectronic books.1 aDavidson, Sinclair,eauthor.1 aPotts, Jason,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788974998 (hardback) 0aNew horizons in institutional and evolutionary economics.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788974998/9781788974998.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889750017 a10.4337/97817889750012doi07564nam a22003615i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184100003000206245027200236264005100508300003400559336002600593337002600619338003600645500002000681505509300701520111705794588003906911650003206950655002206982710004107004776002907045856005507074856004207129024003107171eep9781788978415UtOrBLW20190814141532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190710s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788978415 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHG1811b.E67 20191 aEpstein, Gerald,eauthor.14aThe political economy of central banking :bcontested control and the power of finance, selected essays of Gerald Epstein /cGerald Epstein (professor of economics and co-director, Political Economy Research Institute (PERI), University of Massachusetts-Amherst, US). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (576 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Introduction / Gerald Epstein -- Part I.

This volume explores the economic and political contours of the struggle for influence over the policies of central banks such as the Federal Reserve, and the implications of this struggle for economic performance and the distribution of wealth and power in society. Written over several decades by Gerald Epstein and co-authors, these works explore why central banks do what they do, and how they could better operate. Epstein shows that central banks are a contested terrain over which major economic and political groups fight for control; and demonstrates that though in the US and most other countries, private bankers have the upper-hand in this political struggle, they don't always win. Graduate students, faculty and advanced undergraduates in economics, political science and sociology who are interested in central banking and finance as well as specialists who focus on central banking will find greater understanding of central banks through The Political Economy of Central Banking"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aBanks and banking, Central. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788978408 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788978408.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889784157 a10.4337/97817889784152doi02986nam a22003615i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184100003500205245020200240264005100442300003400493336002600527337002600553338003600579504005100615505035100666520129701017588003902314650001502353655002202368710004102390776005102431856006902482856004202551024003102593eep9781789901597UtOrBLW20190814141532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190710s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781789901597 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB171b.H63 20191 aHodgson, Geoffrey M.,eauthor.10aIs there a future for heterodox economics? :binstitutions, ideology and a scientific community /cGeoffrey M.

But its power in departments of economics has waned. Addressing this paradox, Geoffrey M. Hodgson argues that heterodox economists are defined more by a left ideology than by a shared understanding of the nature of orthodox economics and of what should replace it. Heterodox economists cannot agree on what heterodoxy means. Employing insights from the sociology and philosophy of science, the author explores the marginalization of heterodox economics in the academic community and its exclusion from positions of power. This perceptive book also shows how the weaknesses of a particular version of heterodoxy stemming from the Cambridge economics of the 1970s have been replicated globally in much of contemporary heterodox economics. The author considers how the field can adapt in order to improve and sustain its presence in academia. Social scientists and economists will find this book both enlightening and useful. In particular, it will be invaluable to student networks and others critical of mainstream economics, and to those teaching economics at undergraduate and postgraduate level"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomics. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781789901580 (hardback)z9781789901603 (pbk.)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781789901580/9781789901580.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817899015977 a10.4337/97817899015972doi03440nam a22003615i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184100003400204245016000238264005100398300003400449336002600483337002600509338003600535504005100571505056200622520158401184588003902768650001502807655002202822710004102844776005102885856006902936856004203005024003103047eep9781789901627UtOrBLW20190814141532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190710s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781789901627 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHX73b.H63 20191 aHodgson, Geoffrey M,eauthor.10aIs socialism feasible? :btowards an alternative future /cGeoffrey M Hodgson (Institute for International management, Loughborough University London, UK). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (288 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Preface -- Introduction -- Part I: Socialism, markets and democracy -- 1.

This book shows that it is irretrievably associated with common ownership. The twentieth-century experience of comprehensive national planning with state ownership has been disastrous, and in no case has democracy endured within large-scale socialism. This volume explains why. The alternative socialist option of worker-owned cooperatives must accept a major role for markets that many socialists reject. Featuring theoretical arguments and practical investigations, Geoffrey M. Hodgson interrogates the failures of socialist states, scrutinizing the impact and outcomes of a centralized politico-economic system. This timely and convincing book offers insight into the twentieth-century experience of comprehensive national planning, deploying less-well-known criticisms from Albert Schaffle and Michael Polanyi. Hodgson's nuanced approach brings together small-scale socialist praxis and principles of liberal solidarity, exploring an experimental approach to political and economic reform. Provocative, insightful and accessible, this book is of considerable interest to any reader with an appetite for the history of socialist theory, as well as those keen to explore new insights to heterodox economics. Students and academics of the social sciences and humanities will benefit from this book's rigorous empirical approach to historic and contemporary socialist states and its in-depth discussion of Austrian school theory"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSocialism. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781789901610 (hardback)z9781789901634 (pbk.)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781789901610/9781789901610.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817899016277 a10.4337/97817899016272doi05910nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040002300144042000800167050002200175245040300197264005100600300003400651336002600685337002600711338003600737500002000773505305200793520122603845588003905071650005705110650005305167655002805220700002805248700002905276710004105305776002905346856007605375856004205451024003105493eep9781784715717UtOrBLW20190920131620.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190920s2019    mau     of    001 0 eng    a9781784715717 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLC  apcc 4aLB2324b.H36 201900aHandbook of universities and regional development /cedited by Attila Varga (professor of economics, Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Pčs and MTA-PTE Innovation and Economic Growth Research Group) and Katalin Erdős (assistant professor, Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Pčs, and research fellow, MTA-PTE Innovation and Economic Growth Research Group, Hungary). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (424 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: 1.

It also sheds light on universities as regional development actors from a historical perspective, both by introducing institutional changes and highlighting the interrelatedness of society, business and academia. Chapters provide comprehensive investigations into knowledge transfer mechanisms to explore the diverse ways in which ideas and intellectual property can flow between universities and businesses. Detailed comparative case studies from across the globe expose the highly contextual nature of interactions between academic institutions and their regions. Regional studies scholars will find this Handbook offers a thorough analysis of the topic, as well as a range of key interpretations on the relationships between universities and regional development. Providing important policy recommendations aimed at creating improved relations between academic institutions and their environment, this thought-provoking Handbook is key reading for regional policy makers as well as university managers and administrators"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aUniversities and collegesvHandbooks, manuals, etc.  0aCommunity developmentvHandbooks, manuals, etc.  7aElectronic books.2lcsh1 aVarga, Attila,eeditor.1 aErdos, Katalin,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781784715700 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781784715700/9781784715700.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817847157177 a10.4337/97817847157172doi03028nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040002300144042000800167043002100175050002300196100002700219245021400246250001900460264005100479300003400530336002600564337002600590338003600616500002000652504004100672505031400713520130601027588003902333650003202372655002802404710004102432776002902473856005502502856004202557024003102599eep9781786433503UtOrBLW20190923172715.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190923s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781786433503 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLC  apcc  af------aa------ 4aHG187.4b.V57 20191 aVisser, Hans,eauthor.10aIslamic finance :bprinciples and practice /cHans Visser (professor emeritus of money and banking and international economics, School of Business and Economics, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands).  aThird edition. 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (296 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.  aIncludes bibliographical references.0 aContents: Preface -- Introduction -- 1.

Hans Visser covers recent developments and explores tensions between belief systems and market demands, to consider the future of Islamic finance in the modern marketplace. In this updated third edition, Visser reviews the numerous products, institutions and markets offered by Islamic finance, situating them in the competitive contemporary environment. This incisive book questions the conceptual differences that have been established between Islamic finance and conventional finance, drawing attention instead to how the former imitates the latter. Offering a critical assessment of the claims of the ethical superiority of Islamic finance frequently made by its advocates, Visser further discusses the ways in which fiscal and monetary policy can be adapted to Islamic financial institutions. Concise, yet comprehensive in scope, this book offers new directions for economics and finance students interested in alternatives to conventional finance, as well as students of Islamic finance and Islam studies more broadly. International bankers, financial journalists and politicians will find Visser's succinct exploration of Islamic finance and financial institutions invaluable"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aFinancezIslamic countries. 7aElectronic books.2lcsh2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786433497 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786433497.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864335037 a10.4337/97817864335032doi03722nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040002300144042000800167050002000175245012500195264005100320300003400371336002600405337002600431338003600457490002700493500002000520505094200540520138201482588003902864650004002903650001902943650004302962655002803005700003203033710004103065776002903106830002803135856007603163856004203239024003103281eep9781788119061UtOrBLW20190930150929.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190930s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788119061 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLC  apcc 4aHD76b.R47 201902aA research agenda for media economics /cedited by Alan B.

This innovative book explores an alternative Austrian tradition in economics. Socialist in spirit but too diffuse to be described as a single school of thought, it shares a common conviction that the market, while possibly a good servant, is a very poor master. Demonstrating how the debate on the economics of socialism began in Austria long before the 1930s, this unique book analyses the work and impact of many leading Austrian economists. Beginning with the Austro-Marxist theorists Otto Bauer and Rudolf Hilferding and moving through to the new generation of social democratic economists, most prominently Kurt Rothschild and Josef Steindl, The Alternative Austrian Economics provides insight into the history and evolution of socialist economics in Austria. Offering a previously underrepresented discussion of a century of Austrian socialist economics, this engaging book will prove to be of great value to Marxian and heterodox economists, historians of economic thought and political scientists interested in political economy"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aAustriaxEconomic conditions. 0aEconomistszAustria. 0aSocialismzAustria. 7aElectronic books.2lcsh2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788971508 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788971508/9781788971508.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889715157 a10.4337/97817889715152doi02908nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040002300144042000800167050002100175100002900196245016900225264005100394300003400445336002600479337002600505338003600531500002000567504004100587505041600628520111101044588003902155650002702194650001802221650001602239650001702255655002802272710004102300776002902341856005502370856004202425024003102467eep9781788978521UtOrBLW20190921073324.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190921s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788978521 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLC  apcc 4aHB195b.M66 20191 aMoosa, Imad A.,eauthor.14aThe economics of war :bprofiteering, militarism and imperialsim /cImad A.

In this provocative and illuminating book, Imad Moosa illustrates the economic motivations behind the last 100 years of international conflict, citing the numerous powerful individual and corporate war profiteers that benefit from war. Inspired and informed by War is a Racket, the 1935 work of General Smedley Butler, the author explores historic and contemporary incidents of war profiteering, identifying individuals and groups that have increased their wealth through the supply of weaponry, mercenaries, provisions and finance in times of war. This book offers a caustic indictment of the military-industrial complex, exploring the privatisation of conflict that has fuelled war across the globe. Providing a contemporary, in-depth analysis of the economics of war, this book is critical for academics and students of war studies, international relations and military and political history.

It investigates banks and other financial institutions affected by both state policies and a globalizing financial system, and the financial resources available to firms as well as households. In so doing, the book highlights how an empirical focus on the semi-periphery of the financial system may generate new perspectives on the entanglement between geopolitics and finance. Chapters explore a range of place-specific relations, highlighting the impact of state-led reforms, the importance of models, innovation and adaptation to local conditions, and bank intermediation. Conceptually, the book engages with insights from a variety of disciplines in order to explore the connections between geo-political and geo-economic discourses, public finance and foreign policy, the practices and localization of financial institutions, and the evolution of strategies for globalizing firms. Political and financial geographers will find this book to be a compelling read, as it sheds new light on the semi-periphery, which is often overlooked in studies addressing the global financial system. Economic policy-makers working on the nexus between politics, finance and development will also benefit from reading this book"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aInternational finance. 0aEconomic geography. 7aElectronic books.2lcsh1 aGrandi, Silvia,eeditor.1 aSellar, Christian,eeditor.1 aJafri, Juvaria,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781789903843 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781789903843/9781789903843.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817899038507 a10.4337/97817899038502doi06630cam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040002300144042000800167050002300175245019900198264006700397300002300464336002600487337002600513338003600539490007100575500012600646504004100772505379200813505050404605520076905109650003405878655002805912700003605940710004105976830006806017856008606085856004206171024003106213eep9781786432339UtOrBLW20190827101102.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181218s2019    mau     ob    000 0 eng    a9781786432339 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLC  apcc 4aHB74.P65bC46 201900aChoice and economic welfare /cViktor J.

It analyses material exploring how economics as a scientific enterprise may inform political decision-making. The premise is explored paradigmatically through different interpretations including utility-individualism in the context of welfare economics, preference-individualism in social choice theory, and choice-individualism in constitutional economics.

Two of the most significant are the existence of competitive markets for all goods and services - including futures markets - and the unbounded rationality of all economic agents who act independently to maximize payoffs. In the contributions discussed in this research review, economists come to grips with the consequences of markets falling short of assumptions, as well as the response of institutions to observed market characteristics. This comprehensive study will be of interest to economists and policymakers who wish to understand the strengths and limitations of the market mechanism of resource allocation.  0aCompetition. 0aFree enterprisexPolitical aspects. 7aElectronic books.2lcsh1 aMartin, Stephen,eeditor.  2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics ;v370.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781786432285/9781786432285.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864322927 a10.4337/97817864322922doi07231nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002300184245022300207264006600430300003400496336002600530337002600556338003600582500002000618505482900638520095005467588003906417650002906456600003806485655002206523700005006545700003106595710004106626776002906667856007606696856004206772024003106814eep9781788118569UtOrBLW20190221074531.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181009s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788118569 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB172.5b.E44 201904aThe Elgar companion to John Maynard Keynes /cedited by Robert W.

This comprehensive Companion elucidates his contributions, his significance, his historical context and his continuing legacy. Prominent scholars examine Keynes's life and major writings, his theories and contributions, influences on the development of his thought, his interactions with his contemporaries, his followers and critics, the lasting significance of his work and the changing fortunes of Keynesianism in different countries. The Companion will serve as the standard reference work for all those interested in John Maynard Keynes, in the economics of Keynes and in the history of macroeconomics.  aDescription based on print record. 0aMacroeconomicsxHistory.10aKeynes, John Maynard,d1883-1946. 0aElectronic books.1 aDimand, Robert W.q(Robert William),eeditor.1 aHagemann, Harald,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781847200082 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781847200082/9781847200082.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881185697 a10.4337/97817881185692doi02762nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184100003300204245016500237264006600402300003400468336002600502337002600528338003600554500002000590504004100610505039300651520099701044588003902041650001702080650002102097650001202118655002202130710004102152776002902193856006902222856004202291024003102333eep9781788972994UtOrBLW20190221074531.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181009s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788972994 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD41b.L88 20191 aLütge, Christoph,eauthor.14aThe ethics of competition :bhow a competitive society is good for all /cChristoph Lütge (chair of business ethics, Technical University of Munich, Germany). 1aNorthampton, Massachusetts :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (232 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.  aIncludes bibliographical references.0 aContents: Introduction -- 1.

He highlights how intensified competition can in fact work in favour of ethical goals, and that many criticisms of competition stem from an outdated understanding of how modern societies and economies function. Illustrating this view with examples from ecology, healthcare and education, the author calls for a more entrepreneurial spirit in analysing the relationship between competition and ethics. This book delivers important arguments for the ethics of innovation, using a combination of theoretical and practical evidence to support it. Researchers and scholars of economics, business, philosophy and politics will greatly benefit from the fresh interdisciplinary perspectives and thorough exploration of the complex relationship between modern competition and ethics.  aDescription based on print record. 0aCompetition. 0aBusiness ethics. 0aEthics. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788972987 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788972987/9781788972987.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889729947 a10.4337/97817889729942doi03731nam a22004335i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002100196100002700217245015400244264006600398300003500464336002600499337002600525338003600551490004600587500002000633505096500653520129001618588003902908650001502947600002102962650003102983650001603014655002203030710004103052776002903093830004703122856005503169856004203224024003103266eep9781788973731UtOrBLW20190221074531.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181009s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788973731 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  an-us--- 4aHB171b.F47 20191 aFerri, Piero,eauthor.10aMinsky's moment :ban insider's view on the economics of Hyman Minsky /cPiero Ferri (professor emeritus of economics, University of Bergamo, Italy). 1aNorthampton, Massachusetts :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (264 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aNew directions in modern economics series  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Preface -- 1: Overview -- Part I: "It" happened again -- 2.

He sets out the analytical and methodological foundations of Minsky's financial instability hypothesis, offering insightful comments from a unique insider's perspective. This book stresses the necessity of including what has been recently discovered about Minsky's financial instability hypothesis into his lifelong research program, in order to obtain a more complete picture of both his vision and his analytical apparatus. It seeks to move beyond a discussion of Minsky's original ideas, to verify how they are capable of meeting the challenges derived from the modern evolution of the economy. Developing a meta-model based on regime switching, Piero Ferri examines how the different financial instability hypotheses can be accounted for. Researchers and advanced students in macroeconomics and finance will greatly benefit from the exploration of how Minsky predicted the 'Great Recession', and why his work is of fundamental relevance today. Economic policy makers will also find this book to be a useful tool in discovering methodological innovations to aid further financial recovery from the 2008 economic crisis.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomics.10aMinsky, Hyman P. 0aEconomistszUnited States. 0aRecessions. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788973724 (hardback) 0aNew directions in modern economics series.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788973724.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889737317 a10.4337/97817889737312doi02162nam a22003611i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040004000144050002400184110006500208245013000273264005800403300003500461336002600496337002600522338003600548490005900584505016100643520068200804650003701486650002701523650003001550655002201580710004101602776002901643856005501672856004201727024003101769eep9781788977890UtOrBLW20190221074531.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190215s2019    enk     o     000 0 eng d  a9781788977890 (e-book)  aUtOrBLWbengerdacUtOrBLWdUtOrBLW 4aHF1040.7b.U55 20192 aUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization,eauthor.10aInternational yearbook of industrial statistics 2019 /cUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization (Vienna, Austria). 1aCheltenham :bEdward Elgar Publishing Limited,c2019.  a1 online resource (864 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aInternational yearbook of industrial statistics series0 aContents: Introduction Part I: Summary tables -- Section 1.1 The manufacturing sector -- Section 1.2 The manufacturing divisions -- Part II: Country tables.  aA unique and comprehensive source of information, this book is the only international publication providing economists, planners, policymakers and business people with worldwide statistics on current performance and trends in the manufacturing sector.

Conclusion -- References -- Index.  aJudaism, Christianity and Islam all impose obligations and constraints upon the rightful use of wealth and earthly resources. All three of these religions have well-researched views on the acceptability of practices such as usury but the principles and practices of other, non-interest, financial instruments are less well known. This book examines each of these three major world faiths, considering their teachings, social precepts and economic frameworks, which are set out as a guide for the financial dealings and economic behaviour of their adherents. Religion and Finance explores the histories, denominational compositions and fundamental beliefs of each of the three religions and examines a host of key issues surrounding their relationship to finance. Consideration is given to the development of generally disfavoured practices such as usury, and the various instruments of sales-based debt, partnerships and equity-based financial practices allowed by these religions are examined, alongside a discussion of their socio-economic teachings and traditions. This well-written, well-constructed analysis of the financial thought of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, with its insightful analysis of key financial instruments and economic practices, will be an invaluable book for anyone who is interested in, or studying, the three major Abrahamic religions and their financial practices and philosophies.  aDescription based on print record. 0aAbrahamic religions. 0aJudaismxPhilosophy. 0aChristianityxPhilosophy. 0aIslamxPhilosophy. 0aFinance. 0aElectronic books.1 aKaleem, Ahmad,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9780857939029 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9780857939029/9780857939029.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97808579390367 a10.4337/97808579390362doi03473nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184100003800204245012800242250002000370264005500390300003400445336002600479337002600505338003600531504005100567505052200618520156101140588003902701650004202740650004902782655002202831710004102853776005102894856006902945856004203014024003103056eep9781785367380UtOrBLW20190123074037.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180524s2018    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781785367380 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD75b.V53 20181 aVictor, Peter A.,d1946-eauthor.10aManaging without growth :bslower by design, not disaster /cPeter A.

This book explains why long-term economic growth is infeasible, and why, especially in advanced economies, it is also undesirable. Simulations based on real data show that managing without growth is a better alternative. The book tells how the recent idea of economic growth emerged from the idea of progress, itself only a few hundred years old. Many reasons for questioning growth are given based on an extensive review of the data as well as on conceptual and methodological considerations. The experience of growth in several countries is documented, compared and found wanting. Possibilities for managing without growth in high income economies are simulated with a new, comprehensive systems model with many novel features. Three 50 year scenarios are compared: a base case, an ambitious greenhouse gas reduction scenario, and a sustainable prosperity scenario with broader environmental objectives, reduced income inequality, shorter working hours and the cessation of economic growth. The book closes with a review of policies to make this scenario a reality. This updated book is a valuable resource for a broad academic audience, including students and researchers in economics, environmental studies, environmental science, business studies, and geography, as well as social justice groups and NGOs concerned with the environment, inequality and employment.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomic developmentxSocial aspects. 0aEconomic developmentxEnvironmental aspects. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781785367373 (hardback)z9781785367397 (pbk.)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781785367373/9781785367373.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817853673807 a10.4337/97817853673802doi03125nam a22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184100003000205245017900235264004900414300003400463336002600497337002600523338003600549504005100585505076300636520104401399588003902443650001802482650003102500655002202531710004102553776002902594856005502623856004202678024003102720eep9781786434869UtOrBLW20190123074037.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180919s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781786434869 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB139b.S93 20191 aSwann, G.

Peter Swann argues that economics as a discipline needs both perspectives in order to create the maximum beneficial effect for the economy. Chapters explore how and why mainstream economics is very good at incremental innovation but seems uncomfortable with radical innovation. Swann argues that economics should follow the example of many other disciplines, transitioning from one field to a range of semi-autonomous sub-disciplines. In this book, he compares the missing link in empirical economics to being the economic equivalent of anatomy, the basis of medical discourse. Working as a sequel to Swann's Putting Econometrics in its Place, this book will be a vital resource to those who are discontent with the state of mainstream economics, especially those actively seeking to promote change in the discipline. Students wishing to see progress in the teaching of economics will also benefit from this timely book.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconometrics. 0aTechnological innovations. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786434852 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786434852.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864348697 a10.4337/97817864348692doi03203nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245013600205264004900341300003500390336002600425337002600451338003600477490002700513500002000540505049900560520140501059588003902464650001502503655002202518700003002540710004102570776002902611830002802640856007602668856004202744024003102786eep9781788112314UtOrBLW20190123074037.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180924s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788112314 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB171b.R47 201902aA research agenda for cultural economics /cedited by Samuel Cameron (formerly Professor of Economics, University of Bradford, UK). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (192 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aElgar research agendas  aIncludes index.0 aContents: 1.

Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. Providing a critical overview of cultural economics, this Research Agenda explores the current state of affairs in the field, suggesting methods of improvement for the coherency and progressiveness of future research. Situating work in this area in its historical context, Samuel Cameron draws together a range of international contributors to explore the development of cultural economics. Undertaking a thorough examination of matters of data quality, statistical methodology and the challenge of new developments in technology, chapters examine the different approaches to cultural economics. The book explores the myriad ways in which the topic has been neglected by mainstream economics, and examines reasons why it needs to be considered, evaluated and explored in more detail in our modern world. Current researchers in cultural economics, as well as cultural policies and leisure studies will find this book an invaluable read in exploring different ways to integrate cultural economics into mainstream studies. This Research Agenda will also be an invaluable aid for advanced students to create discussions suitable for essay topics and dissertations.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomics. 0aElectronic books.1 aCameron, Samuel,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788112307 (hardback) 0aElgar research agendas.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788112307/9781788112307.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881123147 a10.4337/97817881123142doi04449nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002300184245036800207264004900575300003500624336002600659337002600685338003600711490004400747505160700791520120202398588003903600650001503639650001903654650002603673655002203699700003203721700002903753710004103782776002903823856007603852830003803928856004203966024003104008eep9781788970105UtOrBLW20190123074038.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180924s2019    mau     o     000 0 eng    a9781788970105 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHC79.D45bR47 201900aResilience and urban disasters :bsurviving cities /cedited by Kamila Borsekova (Faculty of Economics, Matej Bel University, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia), and Peter Nijkamp (Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland, Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS) in 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands and the Universitatea Alexandru Ioan Cuza din Iasi, Iasi, Romania). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (288 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aNew horizons in regional science series0 aContents: Part I: Methodology and disaster impact analysis -- 1.

Including environmental catastrophes, political turbulence and economic shocks, Resilience and Urban Disasters explores a large range of tumultuous events and key case studies to thoroughly cover these core areas. Chapters explore novel contributions on urban evolution and adjustment patterns based on studies from across the globe. Both causal mechanisms and policy responses to the high social costs of urban disasters are addressed. In particular, the book explores the socio-economic impacts on urban systems that are subject to disasters, including migration due to large earthquakes in Japan, the economic impact of terrorist attacks in Istanbul and labour market changes as a result of natural disasters in Italy. Urban planning and urban economics scholars will greatly benefit from the multidisciplinary analyses of a variety of case studies in the book. City planners and urban administrators will also find the exploration of potential paths of resilience for cities to be an invaluable tool for future planning.  aDescription based on print record. 0aDisasters. 0aCity planning. 0aEmergency management. 0aElectronic books.1 aBorsekova, Kamila,eeditor.1 aNijkamp, Peter,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788970099 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788970099/9781788970099.xml 0aNew horizons in regional science.40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889701057 a10.4337/97817889701052doi09545nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002400184245023500208264004900443300003500492336002600527337002600553338003600579490007100615500002000686500012600706505312500832505366703957505034407624520077607968650003208744655002208776700003708798700003208835710004108867830006808908856008608976856004209062024003109104eep9781785367700UtOrBLW20190123074038.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180914s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781785367700 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aBJ1533.F2bE26 201904aThe economics of fairness /cedited by Alexander W.

This review analyses the key theoretical and empirical contributions spanning the last four decades, along with influential related work in normative economics. It argues that the fairness motive is essential for understanding human behavior in a wide range of settings, such as markets, bargaining, and redistributive situations. It moves on to a discussion of the large heterogeneity in what people view as fair and the importance people attach to fairness, displaying how a concern for fairness develops in childhood and manifests itself in the brain. This research review will be a valuable tool for those interested in the fascinating field of the economics of fairness. 0aFairnessxEconomic aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aCappelen, Alexander W.,eeditor.1 aTungodden, Bertil,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics ;v354.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781848443259/9781848443259.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817853677007 a10.4337/97817853677002doi06788nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245021000206264004900416300003500465336002600500337002600526338003600552490007100588500002000659500012600679505350000805505102204305520071305327650002806040655002206068700004406090710004106134830006806175856008606243856004206329024003106371eep9781786439093UtOrBLW20190123074038.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180919s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786439093 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHG3701b.D43 201900aDebt and economic performance /cedited by Cristina D.

Should governments tolerate high public debt or become more indebted given the now prevailing low interest rates? Or is high public debt bad for private sector confidence and growth, by feeding uncertainty, expectation of future tax hikes and an imminent collapse in the wake of the next crisis? This review presents a collection of articles reflecting on these complex and intriguing topics. This review will be useful for policy makers and academics alike, while being particularly suited for those wishing to explore this exciting research area further. 0aDebtxEconomic aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aChecherita-Westphal, Cristina,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics ;v355.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781786439086/9781786439086.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864390937 a10.4337/97817864390932doi08758nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245034400206264004900550300003500599336002600634337002600660338003600686490007100722500002000793500012600813505323800939505321004177520053107387650003407918650002207952655002207974700005107996700003308047710004108080830006808121856008608189856004208275024003108317eep9781788114400UtOrBLW20190123074038.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||180924s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788114400 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF1425b.D86 201900aDumping and antidumping trade protection /cedited by Bruce A.

Choosing the latter is shown to help address climate change, as well as present new economic opportunities. This Handbook provides a deeper understanding of the concept of green growth, and highlights key lessons from the experience of green transformations across the world following a decade of ambitious stimulus packages and green reforms. With comprehensive chapters from key researchers in the field drawn from across the globe, the Handbook on Green Growth offers up to date and original analysis of the many facets of the phenomenon of green growth. Is economic growth desirable? When can economic growth and environmental policies work together? What are the key factors that will achieve green growth? What will be the multiple impacts of green growth? And, what have been the experiences of economies that have undertaken a green transformation? This Handbook will be a key resource for students and academics interested in economics, environmental and ecological studies, as well as for those specialising in environmental policy. It will also be a valuable tool for policy makers concerned about the dual objectives of stimulating economic growth and addressing environmental damage.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSustainable development. 0aEnvironmental policy. 0aElectronic books.1 aFouquet, Roger,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788110679 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788110679/9781788110679.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881106867 a10.4337/97817881106862doi03485nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245007900205264004900284300004100333336002600374337002600400338003600426490002700462504005100489505052700540520165501067588003902722650003702761655002202798700003202820710004102852776002902893830002802922856007602950856004203026024003103068eep9781788116107UtOrBLW20190718115532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190403s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788116107 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aGN448b.R47 201902aA research agenda for economic anthropology /cedited by James G.

Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. Since the financial crisis of 2008, the anthropological study of economic activity has profoundly changed. A Research Agenda for Economic Anthropology poses new questions for anthropologists about the post-recession world, interrogating common social and political assumptions and stimulating innovative directions for research in economic anthropology. Employing a broad range of intellectual orientations, this comprehensive book tackles the most pressing developments in economic anthropology. The stimulating and thought-provoking chapters engage with the major features of modern economies, including inequality, debt, financialisation, neoliberalism and the ethics of economic practice, as well as with the effects of social mobilisation and activism. The contributors shed light on previously overlooked topics, reassess familiar subjects that need a fresh approach and share their own predilections concerning the modern economic world. With contributors ranging from senior academics to those early in their career, this work is critical reading for any anthropologist concerned with the economy and economic activity. Those searching for novel questions or for a sense of the direction of the discipline will particularly benefit from this book's broad, inquisitive approach. Economic sociologists and geographers will also gain from the comprehensive coverage of the many facets of modern economies.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomic anthropologyxResearch. 0aElectronic books.1 aCarrier, James G.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788116091 (hardback) 0aElgar research agendas.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788116091/9781788116091.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881161077 a10.4337/97817881161072doi03259nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002400184100003000208245011300238264004900351300003900400336002600439337002600465338003600491490006500527504005100592505036800643520141601011588003902427650004102466650002002507655002202527700002902549710004102578776002902619830005902648856006902707856004202776024003102818eep9781788116732UtOrBLW20190718115532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190403s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788116732 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aBP173.75b.J36 20191 aJan, Shafiullah,eauthor.12aA model for Islamic development :ban approach in Islamic moral economy /cShafiullah Jan and Mehmet Asutay. 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (ix, 226 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aStudies in Islamic finance, accounting and governance series  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Introduction -- 2.

It presents a new model of Islamic development based on the substantive morality of Islam via micro dynamics expressed through an Islamic framework of spiritual development. Shafiullah Jan and Mehmet Asutay argue that the observed development failures of Muslim countries to provide basic necessities and an environment free of oppression and injustice can be overcome with an authentic Islamic development framework and its corresponding value system explored in the book, rather than the existing Eurocentric theory and policy making. In addition, it identifies the theological, political, social and economic boundaries for changing society to produce IME oriented development. Utilising a novel approach to development in Islam, through its substantive ethical and moral framework, the authors critically examine and evaluate the progress of Islamic banking and finance institutions in relation to its aspirations as identified by IME. Advanced Islamic economics and finance scholars will find this a useful source as it explores the intersection between Islamic development and the moral economy. The book will also be a valuable reference for those seeking to align public policies with ethical and moral Islamic frameworks.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomicsxReligious aspectsxIslam. 0aIslamic ethics. 0aElectronic books.1 aAsutay, Mehmet,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788116725 (hardback) 0aStudies in Islamic finance, accounting and governance.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788116725/9781788116725.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881167327 a10.4337/97817881167322doi05793nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245010500205250004100310264004900351300003900400336002600439337002600465338003600491504005100527505337600578520108203954588003905036650002405075655002205099700003805121700002905159710004105188776002905229856007605258856004205334024003105376eep9781788970020UtOrBLW20190718115532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190225s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788970020 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHT388b.H36 201900aHandbook of regional growth and development theories /cedited by Roberta Capello and Peter Nijkamp.  aRevised and extended second edition. 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (xii, 674 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Preface to the second edition: Novelties and advances / Roberta Capello and Peter Nijkamp -- Part I: Growth theories and space -- 1.

This fully updated, revised and expanded Second Edition contains ten new chapters as well as exploring theories prevalent in the first edition in the face of recent changes in the field. With 30 chapters from leading experts from across the globe, this Handbook looks at new pathways in regional economics, presenting the most cutting-edge theories explaining regional growth and local development. It thoroughly examines recent advances in theories, the normative potentialities that they have and the cross-fertilization of ideas between regional and mainstream economists, providing crucial insights to the topic. This will be an essential source of reference and information for scholars and advanced students of regional science and regional economics. It will also be a useful tool for experts in international institutions researching regional growth.  aDescription based on print record. 0aRegional economics. 0aElectronic books.1 aCapello, Roberta,d1962-eeditor.1 aNijkamp, Peter,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788970013 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788970013/9781788970013.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889700207 a10.4337/97817889700202doi04345nam a22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245017500206264004900381300004000430336002600470337002600496338003600522504005100558505142900609520135902038588003903397650002303436650005503459650004303514650002703557655002203584700003203606700003503638700003103673710004103704776002903745856007603774856004203850024003103892eep9781788976152UtOrBLW20190718115532.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190405s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788976152 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD3611b.T73 201900aTransforming industrial policy for the digital age :bproduction, territories and structural change /cedited by Patrizio Bianchi, Clemente Ruiz Durán, Sandrine Labory. 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (viii, 240 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Part I: Impact of industry 4.0 on manufacturing -- 1.

It demonstrates that industrialization remains an important development process for emerging economies. Featuring contributions by leading scholars, this timely book unpacks the dynamics of 'Industry 4.0', including computer-based algorithms, integration with cloud computing, and the Internet of Things. As existing global value chains take advantage of the new technologies to reorganize production, the contributors explore the implications of new industrial policies, and to what extent they have promoted structural changes that maintain sustainability. This book reflects on the lessons that can be drawn from the history of national industrial policies from across the globe, covering the successes and failures of national policy in promoting industry in response to productive transformations in industrial organization. Insightful and nuanced, this book will benefit scholars of both economics and industrial public policy. International experts and policy-makers will also appreciate this book's critical insight into the transformative shifts in global industrial organization and policies.  aDescription based on print record. 0aIndustrial policy. 0aEmployeesxEffect of technological innovations on. 0aTechnological innovationsxManagement. 0aOrganizational change. 0aElectronic books.1 aBianchi, Patrizio,eeditor.1 aDurán, Clemente R.,eeditor.1 aLabory, Sandrine,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788976145 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788976145/9781788976145.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889761527 a10.4337/97817889761522doi04210nam a22004335i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043002100184050002100205100003200226245076000258264004901018300003501067336002601102337002601128338003601154490006401190500002001254504004101274505021501315520180801530588003903338650004403377650003103421655002203452700003203474710004103506776002903547830005803576856006903634856004203703024003103745eep9781788972192UtOrBLW20190610095539.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190225s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788972192 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  aa-cc---ae-ru--- 4aJC355b.L53 20191 aLibman, Alexander,eauthor.10aFederalism in China and Russia :bstory of success and story of failure? /cAlexander Libman (Professor of Social Sciences and Eastern European Studies, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany, Associate Research Fellow, International Center for the Study of Institutions and Development, National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russia and Associated Researcher, Center for Russian Studies, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China) and Michael Rochlitz (Professor of Institutional Change, Department of Economics, University of Bremen, Germany and Associate Research Fellow, International Center for the Study of Institutions and Development, National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russia). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (232 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aStudies in fiscal federalism and state-local finance series  aIncludes index.  aIncludes bibliographical references.0 aContents: 1.

Libman and Rochlitz argue that the divergence in growth performance between Russia and China can be - at least partially - explained by a number of features of the Chinese system of center-regional relations. The authors offer a comparative analysis of the development of center-region relations in Russia and in China and explore several dimensions of these relations: fiscal ties and incentives; bureaucratic practices; flows of information; and local government practices, while addressing the determinants of divergence between both countries. They also examine how the Chinese system has recently started to change, by adopting several features of the Russian model, which might be one of the reasons for China's declining growth performance in recent years. Federalism in China and Russia should be read by scholars in public economics, political economy and comparative politics, as well as by students and policy analysts. For scholars, the book serves as a point of reference in studying the comparative evolution of the two countries. It will enrich the discussion on fiscal federalism, center-region relations and sub-national political regimes, and could potentially become an important part of syllabi in political economy, public economics and comparative politics courses. For policy analysts, the book offers a comprehensive survey of the evolution of center-periphery relations of the two countries and the differences between them, which is important to better understand the overall development of Russia and China.  aDescription based on print record. 0aFederal governmentzRussia (Federation) 0aFederal governmentzChina. 0aElectronic books.1 aRochlitz, Michael,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788972185 (hardback) 0aStudies in fiscal federalism and state-local finance.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788972185/9781788972185.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889721927 a10.4337/97817889721922doi03366nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184100003400205245012500239264004900364300003500413336002600448337002600474338003600500490004500536500002000581504004100601505040500642520156001047588003902607650003602646650001502682655002202697710004102719776002902760830003902789856005502828856004202883024003102925eep9781788979382UtOrBLW20190610095539.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190225s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788979382 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aJC348b.M33 20191 aMacDonald, Trent J.,eauthor.14aThe political economy of non-territorial exit :bcryptosecession /cTrent J.

However, political economists are increasingly aware of how this form of government neglects the preferences of citizens, resulting in dramatic conflicts. The Political Economy of Non-Territorial Exit explores the theoretical possibility of 'unbundling' government functions and decentralising territorial governance. Employing a variety of theoretical approaches, including new institutional economics, comparative analysis, public choice and Hayekian political economy, Trent J. MacDonald investigates the prospects of a government that separates its traditional functions and decentralises control to non-territorial jurisdictions. Following the history of political-economic thought, the author uncovers an extensive history of non-territorial governance, and provides insight into present-day examples. He emphasises the political mechanism of 'non-territorial secession' and the emerging phenomenon of 'cryptosecession' as the theoretical future of governance. Through an extension of the Coase theorem, this intricate book examines how political systems and jurisdictions change, developing a new theory of spontaneous order. A provocative and enlightening investigation of modern political organisation, MacDonald's vast study is an ideal theoretical guide for scholars and students of political economy. This book also contains critical ideas for policy-makers seeking guidance for the future of political organisation in an increasingly non-territorial world.  aDescription based on print record. 0aNon-self-governing territories. 0aSecession. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788979375 (hardback) 0aNew thinking in political economy.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788979375.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889793827 a10.4337/97817889793822doi09939nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002600184245016600210264004900376300004900425336002600474337002600500338003600526490007100562500012600633505314200759505348103901505097507382520084708357650003109204655002209235700003509257710004109292830006109333856008609394856004209480024003109522eep9781788112017UtOrBLW20190610095539.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190109s2019    mau     o     000 0 eng    a9781788112017 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD7366.5.A3bR43 201900aRecent developments in the economics of housing /cedited by Yannis M.

It discusses articles that cover the housing markets demand and supply whilst considering these factors interactions on real estate valuations, home ownership and wealth decisions. Literature focusing on the interfaces that occur from the dynamics of neighbourhoods and housing prices is analysed and the review delves into how housing markets and their modelling have attracted particular policy interest, such as rent control. Recent analyses of housing markets through a lens that emphasizes the importance of frictions, namely the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides (DMP) model is also extended upon. This review promises to be an informative read to scholars and academics who are immersed in this fascinating topic.   0aHousingxEconomic aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aIoannides, Yannis M.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781788112000/9781788112000.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881120177 a10.4337/97817881120172doi04327nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245013200206264004900338300003500387336002600422337002600448338003600474490002700510500002000537505161400557520138802171588003903559650001303598650001503611655002203626700003403648710004103682776002903723830002803752856007603780856004203856024003103898eep9781786439314UtOrBLW20190314093535.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181213s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786439314 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aG155.A1bR47 201902aA research agenda for tourism geographies /cedited by Dieter K.

Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. Over recent years, tourism geographies have developed into a vibrant field of research, facing increasing challenges from globalisation and environmental change. This Research Agenda presents a unique and original collection of contributions from both established and up-and-coming scholars in thea field. Encompassing both contemporary issues, and paving the way for future avenues of research, this book explores and develops research on tourism geographies. Chapters address emerging themes and apply new methodologies, allowing for intellectual and practical challenges to be tackled. With fresh global insights, this book expands on the geographic dimension of tourism work and workers, the challenges brought by changing economic atmospheres, spatial dynamics, big data and climate change to provide a thorough understanding of the field. Ideal for graduate and post-graduate students of geography and tourism studies looking to develop thesis ideas, this Research Agenda highlights the interest and potential of tourism geographers to contribute to a geographical tradition and influence the future content of geography as a discipline.  aDescription based on print record. 0aTourism. 0aGeography. 0aElectronic books.1 aMüller, Dieter K.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786439307 (hardback) 0aElgar research agendas.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781786439307/9781786439307.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864393147 a10.4337/97817864393142doi05011nam a22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184100005600206245040100262264004900663300003400712336002600746337002600772338003600798500002000834505229600854520115103150588003904301650004004340655002204380700003704402710004104439776002904480856005504509856004204564024003104606eep9781788973656UtOrBLW20190314093535.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181213s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788973656 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB3722b.G66 20191 aGoodhart, C.

Tsomocos examine the interaction of monetary and regulatory policy to achieve the important goals of price and financial stability. Their focus is on the relationship between liquidity and default in the post-crisis context, with special emphasis on macroprudential regulation. Exploring how financial stability can be continually assessed and measured, Financial Regulation and Stability discusses the interrelationships between liquidity and default. Without default there would be no concern about liquidity. But the financial crisis was not just a liquidity problem, it requires a general equilibrium model. The authors' model delineates all the potential interrelationships between the real and financial sectors of the economy, with special emphasis on the interaction between liquidity and default. Economists and central bankers will greatly benefit from the practical advice offered in this book to aid financial stability. Advanced students of financial economics will also find this a vital read to understand the consequences of the 2007-8 financial crisis in more depth and the lessons to be learnt.  aDescription based on print record. 0aGlobal Financial Crisis, 2008-2009. 0aElectronic books.1 aTsomocos, Dimitrios P.,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788973649 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788973649.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889736567 a10.4337/97817889736562doi11004nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002300184245016600207264004900373300003500422336002600457337002600483338003600509490007100545500002000616500012600636505307100762505329703833505243307130520070209563650002210265655002210287700002910309710004110338830006810379856008610447856004210533024003110575eep9781784716325UtOrBLW20190314093535.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181010s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781784716325 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD62.45b.E26 201904aThe economics of transfer pricing /cedited by Lorraine Eden (Professor of Management and Gina and Anthony Bahr Professor in Business, Texas A&M University, US). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (960 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aThe international library of critical writings in economics ;v357  aIncludes index.  aThe recommended readings are available in the print version, or may be available via the link to your library's holdings.8 aRecommended readings (Machine generated): 1.

The assessment involves a multilevel spatial analysis approach at both the national and the regional level. The methods include partial equilibrium analysis characterized by a spatial econometric modeling and the state-of-the-art computable general equilibrium modeling. It provides a basis for policy decision-making and operational considerations. Academic scholars and students who are specialized in regional economics, urban planning, public policy, and transportation will find this book useful. Practitioners and policy-makers will also find this book valuable as the empirical findings provide implications for future transportation planning and development.  aDescription based on print record. 0aHigh speed trainszChina. 0aEconomic geography. 0aElectronic books.1 aHaynes, Kingsley E.,eauthor.1 aZhou, Yulong,dactive 2019,eauthor.1 aDai, Zhaoxin,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781785366031 (hardback) 0aNew horizons in regional science.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781785366031.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817853660487 a10.4337/97817853660482doi03909nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002300184100003500207245019300242264004900435300003400484336002600518337002600544338003600570500002000606505072400626520179501350588003903145650004003184650002303224650001303247655002203260700003103282710004103313776002903354856005503383856004203438024003103480eep9781786431530UtOrBLW20190314093534.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181031s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786431530 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB172.5b.I54 20191 aIngrao, Bruna,d1947-eauthor.10aBanks and finance in modern macroeconomics :ba historical perspective /cBruna Ingrao and Claudio Sardoni (Department of Social and Economic Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (296 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Part I From the 1920s to the early postwar period 1.

Conclusions -- Index.  aIn this significant new book, Bruna Ingrao and Claudio Sardoni emphasize the crucial importance of considering credit/debt relations and financial markets for a comprehensive understanding of the world in which we live. The book offers both a thorough historical and theoretical reconstruction of how 20th century macroeconomics got (or did not get) to grips with the interactions between banks and financial markets, and the 'real' economy. The book is split into two distinct and thematic parts to expose the different attitudes to banks and finance before and after the Great Depression of the 1930s. Part I explores the period from the turn of the 20th century to the late 1930s, when many important economists devoted great attention to banks and credit relations in their explanations of the working of market economies. Part II discusses the post-war period up until the modern day, when banks and financial markets ceased to be a major concern of mainstream macroeconomics. The 2007-8 crisis gave rise to a renewed interest in credit relations, but many problems inherited from the past still remain open. The authors stress, in particular, the implications of the uneasy, if not impossible, coexistence of the endeavour to set macroeconomics within the framework of general equilibrium theory with the attempt to develop the analysis of the monetary and financial features of actual economies. Macroeconomists will greatly benefit from this timely book as it examines the historical evolution of the discipline, pointing out the major factors that have largely prevented the development of satisfactory analyses of the interrelations of credit, finance and the macroeconomy. Those involved in current economic policy debates will also benefit from the lessons offered in this book.  aDescription based on print record. 0aMacroeconomicsxEconometric models. 0aBanks and banking. 0aFinance. 0aElectronic books.1 aSardoni, Claudio,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781786431523 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781786431523.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864315307 a10.4337/97817864315302doi03115nam a22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002400184100003800208245015700246264004900403300003400452336002600486337002600512338003600538504005100574505041500625520138401040588003902424650002802463650003002491655002202521710004102543776002902584856005502613856004202668024003102710eep9781788974486UtOrBLW20190314093535.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181214s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788974486 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aTJ211.49b.H83 20191 aHudson, Johnq(John R.),eauthor.14aThe robot revolution :bunderstanding the social and economic impact /cthe late John Hudson (formerly Department of Economics, University of Bath, UK). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (192 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Preface -- 1.

In doing so they offer the hope of a golden future, one where the elderly are looked after by companion robots, where the disabled can walk, robot security protects us all, remote rural areas have access to the best urban facilities and there is almost limitless prosperity. But there are dangers. There are fears in the labour market that robots will replace jobs, leaving many unemployed, and increase inequality. In relying too much on robots, people may reduce their human contact and see their cognitive abilities decline. There are even concerns, reflected in many science fiction films, that robots may eventually become competitors with humans for survival. This book looks at both the history of robots, in science and in fiction, as well as the science behind robots. Specific chapters analyse the impact of robots on the labour market, people's attitudes to robots, the impact of robots on society, and the appropriate policies to pursue to prepare our world for the robot revolution. Overall the book strikes a cautionary tone. Robots will change our world dramatically and they will also change human beings. These important issues are examined from the perspective of an economist, but the book is intended to appeal to a wider audience in the social sciences and beyond.  aDescription based on print record. 0aRobotsxSocial aspects. 0aRobotsxEconomic aspects. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788974479 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788974479.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889744867 a10.4337/97817889744862doi03448nam a22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184100003400204245018400238264004900422300003400471336002600505337002600531338003600557500002000593505070900613520144901322588003902771650001502810650002902825655002202854710004102876776002902917856005502946856004203001024003103043eep9781788979665UtOrBLW20190314093534.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181010s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788979665 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB75b.W55 20191 aWilliamson, Dean V.,eauthor.14aThe economics of adaptation and long-term relationships /cDean Victor Williamson (Research economist at the Antitrust Division of the US Department of Justice from 1998 to 2018). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (304 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Preface -- 1.

Or is the economic analysis of institutions a distraction from the most important action? Indeed, does Vernon Smith's notion of the "institution-free core" of formal economic theory encompass that most important action? Would that render an "economics of organization" almost devoid of economic content? The author takes up an approach that is more agnostic, inter-disciplinary and even a little irreverent. What can theory do and not do? Theory can stimulate questions about how parties manage competing demands for commitment and flexibility in their relationships but what blind spots persist? The book opens with an informal tour of the economics of system design out of which an economics of adaptation ultimately emerged. It then offers explorations, via the application of the economics of adaptation in both law and economics' relating to how parties manage relationships within the firm, within the context of long-term contracts and, most vividly, within the context of antitrust conspiracy. Advanced undergraduates, graduate students and teaching faculty in economics, public policy, management and law will find the book relevant, as it maps out connections between literatures that are not often made explicit. For historians of economic thought the book lays out a much richer understanding of what the economics of organization is (and is not), and situates it next to design economics.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomics. 0aInterpersonal relations. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781849800372 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781849800372.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889796657 a10.4337/97817889796652doi04591nam a22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002300184245038800207264004900595300003500644336002600679337002600705338003600731490002700767500002000794505151100814520140102325588003903726650001803765650003403783655002203817700002703839700002603866700003003892710004103922776002903963830002803992856007604020856004204096024003104138eep9781788114226UtOrBLW20190515122541.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190225s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788114226 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHG178.3b.R47 201902aA research agenda for financial inclusion and microfinance /cedited by Marek Hudon (Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management, CERMi-Université Libre de Bruxelles), Marc Labie (Warocqué School of Business and Economics, CERMi-Université de Mons), and Ariane Szafarz (Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management, CERMi-Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (200 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aElgar research agendas  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Introduction -- Part I: Framing research on microfinance and financial inclusion -- 1.

This piece focuses on research that investigates the causes and consequences of structural change with either theoretical or calibrated models, mindfully referring to some of the most celebrated literature over the last two decades. The research review analyses literature covering the impact structural change has on an array of economic factors including convergence, per capita income and spatial development. Prefaced by an original introduction from the editors, this collection would be well suited to scholars and macro-development economists wishing to extend their knowledge of this compelling topic.  aThe recommended readings are available in the print version, or may be available via the link to your library's holdings. 0aEconomic development. 0aSustainable development. 0aElectronic books.1 aYi, Kei-Mu,eeditor.1 aSposi, Michael,eeditor.1 aZhang, Jing,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781786437389/9781786437389.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864373967 a10.4337/97817864373962doi12790nam a22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245057300205264004900778300003500827336002600862337002600888338003600914490007100950500002001021505398701041505418705028505179409215520082811009500012611837650002411963655002211987700003212009700002812041700003112069710004112100830006812141856008612209856004212295024003112337eep9781786437686UtOrBLW20190515122541.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181219s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786437686 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHT388b.R44 201900aRegional economic advantage /cedited by Bjørn T.

It helps the reader to understand how regions build advantage for industrial development through the use of endogenous and exogenous resources, how regional industrial development can be supported by place-based policy, and how the form and mechanisms of regional advantage change over time in a path dependent manner. Also analysed is research on industrial districts and new industrial spaces, as well as regional clusters and innovation systems, along with more recent discussion of global development impulses and evolutionary perspectives on regional development. Written by three experts in the field, this important review is an essential resource for those studying, researching or practicing in this area.  aThe recommended readings are available in the print version, or may be available via the link to your library's holdings. 0aRegional economics. 0aElectronic books.1 aAsheim, Bjørn T.,eeditor.1 aIsaksen, Arne,eeditor.1 aTrippl, Michaela,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics ;v363.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781786437679/9781786437679.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864376867 a10.4337/97817864376862doi10342nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245033700206264004900543300003500592336002600627337002600653338003600679490007100715500002000786505319900806505354604005505093107551520094208482500012609424650002909550655002209579700003009601700003309631710004109664830006809705856008609773856004209859024003109901eep9781786439116UtOrBLW20190515122541.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||181219s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781786439116 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHC79.E5bS87 201900aSustainability economics /cedited by Giles Atkinson (Professor of Environmental Policy, Department of Geography and Environment, London School of Economics and Political Science), and Sam Fankhauser (Director, Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, London School of Economics and Political Science, UK). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (896 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aThe international library of critical writings in economics ;v361  aIncludes index.8 aRecommended readings (Machine generated): 1.

The Sustainable Development Goals, agreed globally in 2015, define a vision of human development where economic, social and environmental domains interact to shape the prospects for future prosperity. This timely literature review highlights the contribution of economics to the study of sustainable development. It discusses some of the most influential articles on the topic by economists over the past fifty years. Environmental sustainability, an inherently interdisciplinary topic, is analysed from the perspectives of applied microeconomics, environmental and resource economics, ecological economics, development economics and public economics. Written by two subject experts, this research review is indispensable for anyone interested or working in the field.  aThe recommended readings are available in the print version, or may be available via the link to your library's holdings. 0aSustainable development. 0aElectronic books.1 aAtkinson, Giles,eeditor.1 aFankhauser, Samuel,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics ;v361.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781786439109/9781786439109.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864391167 a10.4337/97817864391162doi09875nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184100002900206245015300235264004900388300003500437336002600472337002600498338003600524490007100560500002000631505363000651505373004281505018108011520079208192500012608984650002509110650004009135655002209175710004109197830006809238856008609306856004209392024003109434eep9781788114448UtOrBLW20190515122541.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190109s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788114448 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHF1379b.H86 20191 aHumphrey, John,eauthor.10aGlobal value chains /cJohn Humphrey (Honorary Professor, Department of Strategy and Marketing, University of Sussex Business School, Brighton, UK). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (896 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aThe international library of critical writings in economics ;v362  aIncludes index.8 aRecommended readings (Machine generated): 1.

Focusing on globalization, fragmentation and coordination of production across geographical as well as enterprise boundaries. It pays particularly close attention to how businesses in developing countries are incorporated into global production and distribution networks. The review analyses many of the texts that framed the global value chain approach together with in-depth case-studies of particular sectors and policy-oriented research concerned with reducing poverty and accelerating growth in poorer countries. This review would be of great interest to students and researchers working in the fields of globalisation, geography and international business.  aThe recommended readings are available in the print version, or may be available via the link to your library's holdings. 0aInternational trade. 0aInternational business enterprises. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics ;v362.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781788114431/9781788114431.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881144487 a10.4337/97817881144482doi03726nam a22004335i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184100002500206245031000231246005400541264004900595300003400644336002600678337002600704338003600730504005100766505055700817520147901374588003902853650003102892650002602923655002202949700002902971700003603000700003003036700002803066710004103094776002903135856005503164856004203219024003103261eep9781788118958UtOrBLW20190515122541.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190109s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788118958 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHC79.C3bP55 20191 aPike, Andy,eauthor.10aFinancialising city statecraft and infrastructure /cAndy Pike, Peter O'Brien, Tom Strickland, Graham Thrower (Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies (CURDS), Newcastle University), and John Tomaney (Bartlett School of Planning, Faculty of the Built Environment, University College London, UK).3 aFinancializing city statecraft and infrastructure 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (360 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: 1.

Through new conceptual work and fresh empirical analysis, this book investigates how financialisation engages with city governance and infrastructure provision, identifying its wider and longer-term implications for urban and regional development, politics and policy. Proposing a more people-oriented approach to answering the question of 'What kind of urban infrastructure, and for whom?', this book addresses the struggles of national and local governments to fund, finance and govern urban infrastructure. It develops new insights to explain the socially and spatially uneven mixing of managerial, entrepreneurial and financialised city governance in austerity and limited decentralisation across England. As urban infrastructure fixes for the London global city-region risk undermining national 'rebalancing' efforts in the UK, city statecraft in the rest of the country is having uneasily to combine speculation, risk-taking and prospective venturing with co-ordination, planning and regulation. This book will be of interest to researchers and scholars in the fields of business and management, economics, geography, planning, and political science. Its conclusions will be valuable to policymakers and practitioners in both the public and private sectors seeking insights into the intersections of financialisation, decentralisation and austerity in the UK, Europe and globally.   aDescription based on print record. 0aInfrastructure (Economics) 0aCorporate governance. 0aElectronic books.1 aO'Brien, Peter,eauthor.1 aStrickland, Thomas L.,eauthor.1 aThrower, Graham,eauthor.1 aTomaney, John,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788118941 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788118941.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881189587 a10.4337/97817881189582doi03022nam a22003735i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184100003100204245021000235264004900445300003400494336002600528337002600554338003600580504005100616505043400667520123901101588003902340650002602379650002302405655002202428710004102450776002902491856005502520856004202575024003102617eep9781788975292UtOrBLW20190515122541.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190109s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788975292 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD82b.C47 20191 aCerisola, Silvia,eauthor.10aCultural heritage, creativity and economic development /cSilvia Cerisola (Post-Doc Researcher, Architecture, Built Environment and Construction Engineering (ABC) Department, Politecnico di Milano, Italy). 1aNorthampton, MA :bEdward Elgar Pub.,c2019.  a1 online resource (208 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: 1.

Using a strong theoretical and empirical framework, Silvia Cerisola explores how cultural heritage, creativity and economic development are inextricably linked. This book is a clear econometric demonstration of how cultural heritage, through its inspirational role on different creative talents, generates an indirect positive effect on local economic development. These positive results justify important new policy recommendations in the field of cultural heritage. Interpreting both creativity and cultural heritage in a novel way, the author offers a new reading of the long lasting debate on the topic, examining different perspectives and impacts on the welfare of the local community. Regional science scholars will greatly appreciate the original conceptual framework and the empirical foundations of the book, as well as the thorough explanation of different approaches to the measurement of creativity. Policy-makers and stakeholders will also benefit from the case studies highlighting the importance of cultural heritage.   aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomic development. 0aCultural property. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788975285 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788975285.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889752927 a10.4337/97817889752922doi04580nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245017300205264005100378300003400429336002600463337002600489338003600515500002000551505204200571520109702613588003903710650001603749650002503765650002803790655002203818700003503840700002803875700004803903710004103951776002903992856007604021856004204097024003104139eep9781785365003UtOrBLW20191120084032.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190601s2019    mau     o     011 0 eng    a9781785365003 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB501b.I57 201900aInstitutions and evolution of capitalism :bessays in honour of Geoffrey M.

To mark his seminal work, this book features original contributions by world-leading scholars from fields that have played a significant role in influencing his thinking or represent key debates to which he has contributed. Building on some of the central philosophical and methodological foundations underlying Hodgson's thinking, the book is organised around the recurring themes of institutions, evolution and capitalism. The contributors explore key connections between philosophy, the history of economic thought, and institutional and evolutionary economics in the light of Hodgson's often path-breaking work. A vital read for institutional, evolutionary and heterodox economists, this book sheds new light on Hodgson's position in these fields. Drawing together critical insights, this is also an important book for economic scholars looking to improve their understanding of current theory"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aCapitalism. 0aCapitalismxHistory. 0aFinancial institutions. 0aElectronic books.1 aGagliardi, Francesca,eeditor.1 aGindis, David,eeditor.1 aHodgson, Geoffrey Martin,d1946-ehonouree.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781785364990 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781785364990/9781785364990.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817853650037 a10.4337/97817853650032doi04050nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184100003300205245056700238264005100805300003500856336002600891337002600917338003600943490006400979504005101043505066701094520147301761588003903234650002403273650002303297655002203320700003803342700004803380710004103428776002903469856006903498856004203567024003103609eep9781788972178UtOrBLW20191120084032.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190919s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788972178 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aJC355b.H36 20191 aHankla, Charles R.,eauthor.10aLocal accountability and national coordination in fiscal federalism :ba fine balance /cCharles R.

This book offers both an explanation for such mixed effects and a roadmap for better outcomes in the future. It argues that the benefits of fiscal federalism are contingent on a particular confluence of political institutions, namely democratic decentralization and political party integration. With this in mind, the authors emphasize the importance of striking a "fine balance" between the accountability benefits delivered by empowered local governments and the national coordination necessary for good policy outcomes. Such a balance can be achieved, they contend, when integrated party structures compensate for the potential downsides of a decentralized state. The book formalizes this argument for a variety of electoral democracies and, using new data on subnational political institutions, tests it with models of education, health, and infrastructure service delivery in 135 countries across 30 years. It also presents comparative case studies of Senegal and Nigeria. Academic economists and political scientists will value the book for its contribution to the literature on fiscal federalism and political decentralization, and development practitioners will benefit from its practical solutions to the problems of local governance"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aFederal government. 0aPolitical parties. 0aElectronic books.1 aMartinez-Vazquez, Jorge,eauthor.1 aPonce Rodríguez, Raúl Alberto,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788972161 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788972161/9781788972161.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889721787 a10.4337/97817889721782doi03289nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002400184245017100208246004100379264005100420300003500471336002600506337002600532338003600558490003400594500002000628505070700648520118301355588003902538650001902577650002202596655002202618700003202640710004102672776002902713856007602742856004202818024003102860eep9781789903751UtOrBLW20191120084032.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190919s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781789903751 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD2336.3b.T45 201900aTelework in the 21st century :ban evolutionary perspective /cedited by Jon C.

This insightful book demonstrates how telework has evolved in the last four decades, as technological developments have improved our capacity to work remotely. Based on a new conceptual framework, this book explores the global variations in telework, examining the effects on working conditions and individual and organizational performance. Breaking the traditional intellectual conception that telework is performed only in the home, this book surveys the full breadth of working environments, as technology allows employees increased working mobility. Contributors expose a profound ambiguity surrounding the effects of 21st-century telework, revealing that its advantages and disadvantages may simply be two sides of the same coin. This timely book is crucial reading for researchers of labour and employment interested in the evolution of contemporary telework and the influence of modern technologies in the workplace. Policy-makers will also benefit from this book's concrete policy recommendations to improve the practice of telework"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aTelecommuting. 0aWork environment. 0aElectronic books.1 aMessenger, Jon C.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781789903744 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781789903744/9781789903744.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817899037517 a10.4337/97817899037512doi02676nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184100002800205245012700233264005100360300003400411336002600445337002600471338003600497504005100533505015000584520118800734588003901922650001501961650001601976650004201992655002202034710004102056776005102097856006902148856004202217024003102259eep9781789908428UtOrBLW20191120084032.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190921s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781789908428 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB171b.N66 20191 aNooteboom, B.,eauthor.10aUprooting economics :ba manifesto for change /cBart Nooteboom (Professor Emeritus, Tilburg University, the Netherlands). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (160 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Introduction -- 1: Crisis of capitalism -- 2: Economics -- 3: Markets -- 4: Industries -- 5: A new economics -- Bibliography -- Index.   a"Much-needed in the face of present political upheavals, including the rise of populism and re-emergence of nationalism and authoritarian regimes, this book is radical in both its critique and proposals for a new economics. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, Bart Nooteboom offers insights from economics, sociology, cognitive science, social psychology and philosophy. Exploring ways in which economics is developing, the book investigates how new economics has moved away from considering individuals as autonomous and instead studies their involvement and interactions with each other. The book discusses a new relational economics: less contractual, hierarchical and controlled, and more based on trust and mutual adjustment. Nooteboom proposes a shift from utility ethics to the virtue ethics of prudence, courage, moderation and justice. A provocative read for economics students, this work is especially pertinent to those interested in rethinking the subject and expanding upon heterodox theories. It will also prove a useful read to critical economists and sociologists looking to better understand a way forward in our current economic climate"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEconomics. 0aCapitalism. 0aEconomicsxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781789908411 (hardback)z9781789908435 (pbk.)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781789908411/9781789908411.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817899084287 a10.4337/97817899084282doi10926nam a22004335i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184245018900204264005100393300003700444336002600481337002600507338003600533490007100569500002000640500012600660505340400786505357704190505130807767520096009075650002610035650002910061650004610090650004310136655002210179700002910201710004110230830006110271856008710332856004210419024003110461eep9781788118859UtOrBLW20191120084032.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190921s2020    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788118859 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD82b.I57 202000aInstitutions and economic development /cedited by Jakob de Haan (Head of Research, De Nederlandsche Bank and Professor of Political Economy, University of Groningen, the Netherlands). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2020.  a1 online resource (1,576 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aThe international library of critical writings in economics series  aIncludes index.  aThe recommended readings are available in the print version, or may be available via the link to your library's holdings.8 aRecommended readings (Machine generated): 1.

Economic institutions shape economic incentives, such the incentives to become educated, to save and invest, to innovate and to adopt new technologies. Although economic institutions are critical for determining whether a country is poor or prosperous, it is politics and political institutions that determine which economic institutions are present in a country. This collection explores these critical relationships and the causes of economic growth, whilst bringing forth the legal, colonial and financial factors, which contribute, to economic discrepancies across countries. Prefaced by an authoritative introduction by the editor, this collection promises to be a valuable tool for economic researchers and scholars interested in this important subject"--cProvided by publisher. 0aEconomic development. 0aInstitutional economics. 0aFinancial institutionsxEconomic aspects. 0aPolitics, PracticalxEconomic aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aHaan, Jakob de,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781788118842/9781788118842.xml 40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881188597 a10.4337/97817881188592doi07236nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245020700205264005100412300003500463336002600498337002600524338003600550490007100586500002000657500012600677505345200803505140804255520080305663650002106466650003406487655002206521700003406543710004106577830006106618856008606679856004206765024003106807eep9781788119788UtOrBLW20191120084032.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190921s2020    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788119788 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHT321b.E26 202004aThe economics of agglomeration /cedited by William C.

Agglomeration economies are manifested in cities and industry clusters shaping the neighborhoods and the regions that contain them. The literature is unified around several themes: Improvements in econometric methods and data, geographic scales at which agglomeration economies operate, micro-neighborhoods and mega-regions. The volume also uncovers the forces driving the field including labor markets, input markets and dynamic phenomena such as innovation, technology change and growth. Prefaced by an original introduction from the editor, this collection promises to be a useful tool for scholars as well as a fascinating read to those interested in the subject area"--cProvided by publisher. 0aUrban economics. 0aMegacitiesxEconomic aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aStrange, William C.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781788119771/9781788119771.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881197887 a10.4337/97817881197882doi03420nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002400184100003400208245039700242264005100639300003400690336002600724337002600750338003600776500002000812505038700832520144201219588003902661650003202700655002202732700003502754700003302789710004102822776002902863856006902892856004202961024003103003eep9781788115834UtOrBLW20191022091542.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190907s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788115834 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aKBP998.2b.B55 20191 aBillah, Mohd Ma'Sum,eauthor.10aEncyclopedia of Islamic insurance, Takaful and Retakaful /cMohd Ma'Sum Billah (Professor of Finance and Insurance, Islamic Economics Institute, King Abdulaziz University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia), Ezzedine Ghlamallah (Entrepreneur and Founding President, SAAFI, France) and Christos Alexakis (Associate Professor, Department of Finance and Accounting, ESC Rennes School of Business, France). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (448 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Preface -- Foreword -- Introduction -- Bibliography -- 1.

The authors explore the ways in which Islamic insurance can be halal, contradicting the widely held belief that insurance policies are not appropriate or moral, utilizing evidence from both the Qu'ran and top Islamic scholars to do so. The book explores Takaful, an insurance paradigm that is in accordance with Islamic principles and suits the needs of modern Islamic economies and communities. It examines the practices, principles, framework and importance of the notion of Takaful, using evidence from the Qu'ran and Islamic teachings to support this. Chapters examine how Takaful is different to conventional insurance models that are not permissible under Shari'ah law, contradicting misconceptions about the possibility of an insurance policy that is achievable within Islamic communities. The book further explores the room for cooperation between Takaful services and Islamic banking, offering insight into how this can be improved in the future. A valuable asset for Islamic insurance and Islamic economics scholars, this timely book offers a thorough analysis of Takaful, Retakaful and Islamic insurance in our modern world. It will also be a useful read for those practising Takaful to ensure that their advice coheres with Shari'ah law"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aInsurance law (Islamic law) 0aElectronic books.1 aGhlamallah, Ezzedine,eauthor.1 aAlexakis, Christos,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788115827 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788115827/9781788115827.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881158347 a10.4337/97817881158342doi03213nam a22003855i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184100003600204245028200240264005000522300003400572336002600606337002600632338003600658504005100694505033600745520135301081588003902434650003902473650004402512650005102556655002202607710004102629776002902670856005502699856004202754024003102796eep9781788978835UtOrBLW20191022091542.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190828s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788978835 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD60b.P83 20191 aPuaschunder, Julia M.,eauthor.10aIntergenerational equity :bcorporate and financial leadership /cJulia M.

The book explores how corporate and financial social responsibility can leverage intergenerational harmony through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Socially Responsible Investment (SRI). A warming earth under climate change, overindebtedness crises and demographic aging of a Western world population are putting pressure on future generations. Transparency and accountability are key for monitoring corporate and financial social responsibility in the interplay of public and private actors to ensure a sustainable humankind and intergenerational harmony. The author discusses the human constituents of responsibility and the international emergence of CSR, paying special attention to global governance multi-stakeholder partnerships. The rise of SRI in the international arena in the wake of stakeholder activism and intrinsic socio-psychological motives of socially responsible investors are also outlined and the role of leadership, trust and managerial ethics accentuated. Scholars, executives and readers motivated by the desire to improve corporate and financial market activities will benefit from this insightful and valuable book"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSocial responsibility of business. 0aInvestmentsxMoral and ethical aspects. 0aIntergenerational relationsxEconomic aspects. 0aElectronic books.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788978828 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788978828.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889788357 a10.4337/97817889788352doi04380nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245031400206264005100520300003500571336002600606337002600632338003600658490002400694504005100718505171500769520110402484588003903588650002903627650002103656655002203677700003603699700002803735710004103763776002903804856007603833856004203909024003103951eep9781789905083UtOrBLW20191022091543.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190921s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781789905083 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHC79.E5bM63 201902aA modern guide to state intervention :beconomic policies for growth and sustainability /cEdited by Nikolaos Karagiannis (Professor of Economics, Winston-Salem State University, US) and John E.

Building on important factors including history, the role of institutions, society and economic structures, this Modern Guide considers economic and administrative interventions towards changing the destabilized status quo of modern societies. Exploring a variety of theoretical approaches, chapters offer sustainable growth-inducing policies and proposals to address important challenges in this era of neoliberal globalization and financialization. With key contributions by distinguished academics in the field, the book evaluates past efforts and policies and critiques failed perspectives. A critical read for political economics scholars wishing to look beyond orthodox perspectives, this book highlights key areas of contention in modern economic policies. This will also be a vital book for policy-makers and economists looking ahead to a more sustainable economic atmosphere"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSustainable development. 0aEconomic policy. 0aElectronic books.1 aKaragiannis, Nikolaos,eeditor.1 aKing, John E.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781789905076 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781789905076/9781789905076.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817899050837 a10.4337/97817899050832doi11554nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245028900206264005100495300003500546336002600581337002600607338003600633490007100669500012600740504005100866505379700917505376504714505160408479520066410083650004010747650003910787655002210826700003110848710004110879830006110920856009010981856004211071024003111113eep9781788971539UtOrBLW20191022091543.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190919s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788971539 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHC79.E5bE26 201904aThe economics of climate resilience and adaptation /cEdited by Sam Fankhauser (Director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and Director of the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, London School of Economics and Political Science, UK). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (912 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aThe international library of critical writings in economics series  aThe recommended readings are available in the print version, or may be available via the link to your library's holdings.  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.8 aRecommended readings (Machine generated): 1.

Human societies can thrive in many climatic conditions. However, such adaptation is not necessarily smooth, and it cannot be taken for granted. This book synthesises the contribution of economics to the study and practice of climate resilience and adaptation. Including an original introduction by the editor, it brings together in one volume some of the most influential articles by economists on climate change adaptation since the topic became a subject of academic interest"--cProvided by publisher. 0aClimatic changesxEconomic aspects. 0aAcclimatizationxEconomic aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aFrankhauser, Sam,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/abstract/Research_Reviews/9781788971522/9781788971522.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889715397 a10.4337/97817889715392doi03816nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002700184245020200211264005100413300003500464336002600499337002600525338003600551490002700587504005100614505108800665520126301753588003903016650003503055655002203090700003303112700002603145710004103171776002903212830002803241856007603269856004203345024003103387eep9781788118583UtOrBLW20190912111033.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190730s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788118583 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHD9999.C9472bR47 201902aA research agenda for creative industries /cEdited by Stuart Cunningham and Terry Flew (Digital Media Research Centre, Creative Industries Faculty, Queensland University of Technology, Australia). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (200 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aElgar research agendas  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Introduction: A forward agenda for creative industries research / Stuart Cunningham and Terry Flew -- 1.

Leading scholars are given the space to explore their subject in provocative ways, and map out the potential directions of travel. They are relevant but also visionary. Over the past 20 years, the concept of creative industries has become a widely recognised policy paradigm adopted in numerous countries, agencies and educational institutions around the world. A Research Agenda for Creative Industries probes the key issues that will help to advance research into creative industries as a productive and innovative intervention in public policy. Issues addressed include how much should a research agenda for creative industries be policy-oriented? How workable is the so-called triple bottom line rationale for creative industries? What innovative theories, research approaches and methods are called for in advancing a creative industries agenda? With contributions from leading scholars, policy and industry specialists, this interdisciplinary Research Agenda will be a vital resource for students and academics working in the fields of communication, culture, film and media, geography, business and policy studies, and Internet and social media studies"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aCultural industriesxResearch. 0aElectronic books.1 aCunningham, Stuart,eeditor.1 aFlew, Terry,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788118576 (hardback) 0aElgar research agendas.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788118576/9781788118576.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881185837 a10.4337/97817881185832doi03856nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002300184100003300207245028300240250002000523264005100543300003400594336002600628337002600654338003600680504005100716505105900767520122401826588003903050650004203089650001703131650003103148655002203179700003303201710004103234776002903275856006903304856004203373024003103415eep9781784717193UtOrBLW20190912111033.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190724s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781784717193 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHG230.3b.F76 20191 aFroyen, Richard T.,eauthor.10aOptimal monetary policy under uncertainty /cRichard T.

The authors have grounded New Keynesian research of the 1990s and 2000s in the literature of the 1970s, which viewed optimal policy as primarily a question of the optimal use of information, and studies in the 1980s that gave primacy to time inconsistency problems. The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-09 led to the recognition that financial markets and institutions required greater attention in policy modelling. Herein, the authors provide a thorough survey of the post-crisis literature that resulted from this recognition. Researchers in academia and at central banks, students and policy makers will value the wide scope of coverage provided in this examination, leading them to a better understanding of issues such as discretion versus commitment, target versus instrument rules, policy in closed versus open economies and the proper mandate for central banks, including the relationship between interest rate policy and macro-prudential instruments"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aMonetary policyxMathematical models. 0aUncertainty. 0aMathematical optimization. 0aElectronic books.1 aGuender, Alfred V.,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781784717186 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781784717186/9781784717186.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817847171937 a10.4337/97817847171932doi04186nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002200184245023500206264005100441300003500492336002600527337002600553338003600579490003900615504005100654505142900705520124302134588003903377650002503416655002203441700003903463700002703502710004103529776002903570830004003599856007603639856004203715024003103757eep9781788119887UtOrBLW20190912111033.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190730s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788119887 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aHB99.7b.P76 201900aProgressive Post-Keynesian economics :bdealing with reality /cEdited by Jesper Jespersen (Professor of Economics, Roskilde University and Aalborg University) and Finn Olesen (Professor of Economics, Aalborg University, Denmark). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (200 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aNew directions in modern economics  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Introduction -- 1.

Taking a pluralistic approach to modern Keynesian economics, the book presents innovative contributions to methodology, analyses of financialization and macroeconomic modeling. It explores how to model a complex macro-system at a time when economic uncertainty is dominant. Rich case studies examine increasing macroeconomic imbalances, paving the way for a better understanding of the political challenges of the future. With chapters dedicated to teaching macroeconomics, the book adopts a practical stance, exploring the notion of moving away from mathematical modeling towards problem-based learning. Provocative and comprehensive, this book is crucial reading for all macroeconomists, from academic researchers to ministerial officials, seeking guidance on dealing with macroeconomic 'reality'. Postgraduate students of heterodox economics and political economy will also benefit from the innovative contributions of top post-Keynesian scholars, offering an alternative understanding of contemporary macroeconomic theory"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aKeynesian economics. 0aElectronic books.1 aJespersen, Jesper,d1948-eeditor.1 aOlesen, Finn,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788119870 (hardback) 0aNew directions in modern economics.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788119870/9781788119870.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881198877 a10.4337/97817881198872doi04316nam a22004095i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176043001200184050002200196245027800218264005100496300003400547336002600581337002600607338003600633504005100669505153600720520115202256588003903408651006303447651005103510655002203561700002903583700004303612700003203655710004103687776002903728856007603757856004203833024003103875eep9781789902600UtOrBLW20190912111033.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190826s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781789902600 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc  ae------ 4aHJ1000b.H69 201900aHow to finance cohesion in Europe? /cEdited by Ewald Nowotny (Governor, Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Austria), Doris Ritzberger-Grünwald (Director, Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Austria) and Helene Schuberth (Head of Division, Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Austria). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (192 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes bibliographical references and index.0 aContents: Part I: Financing economic and social cohesion -- 1.

The book explores various aspects of financialization, such as its role in pension funds, and explores its consequences especially in developing economies. Readers will recognize other key concepts such as the role of banks, and the effectiveness of monetary policy and its transmission mechanism, and unconventional policies, such as quantitative easing. Considerable space is given to income inequality, a topic that has become increasingly important. Authors explore the growing importance of household debt, and policies that could address inequality. Finally, the book discusses the rising importance of dualism, a much under-researched topic in heterodox economics. Policy makers and scholars alike, especially those in Heterodox Economics, will find the book a much need addition to the field"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aKeynesian economics. 0aElectronic books.1 aRochon, Louis-Philippe,eeditor.1 aMonvoisin, Virginie,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788973687 (hardback) 0aNew directions in post-Keynesian economics.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/edcoll/9781788973687/9781788973687.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817889736947 a10.4337/97817889736942doi03241nam a22004215i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002300184100002400207245028100231264005100512300003400563336002600597337002600623338003600649500002000685505051700705520113401222588003902356650002402395650004302419655002202462700003402484700003002518700003102548700002802579710004102607776002902648856006902677856004202746024003102788eep9781788112611UtOrBLW20190912111033.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190729s2019    mau     o     001 0 eng    a9781788112611 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aTJ163.2b.S54 20191 aSkea, Jim,eauthor.10aEnergy innovation for the twenty-first century :baccelerating the energy revolution /cJim Skea, Renée van Diemen (Imperial College London), Matthew Hannon (University of Strathclyde), Evangelos Gazis (Aurora Energy Research) and Aidan Rhodes (Imperial College London, UK). 1aNorthampton :bEdward Elgar Publishing,c2019.  a1 online resource (464 pages)  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  aIncludes index.0 aContents: Part I: Introduction -- 1.

Chapters explore energy policy and institutions, innovation policy in general, as well as energy innovation in key countries, including the US, Germany, the UK, China, Japan and Korea, and the EU. At the heart of Energy Innovation for the 21st Century is a fascinating set of international empirical case studies covering supply and demand side technologies at different levels of maturity. These are set within an analytical framework encompassing the functions of technological innovation systems and innovation metrics. The book explores energy, science and technology policies, contextualising the case studies to aid the assessment of the overall performance of innovation systems. Drawing together lessons for energy innovation policy and institutional design, this book is a much-needed resource for sustainability and innovation scholars and researchers. Policy-makers and practitioners will also benefit from the practical advice offered in this timely volume"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aEnergy development. 0aRenewable natural resourcesxResearch. 0aElectronic books.1 avan Diemen, Renée,eauthor.1 aHannon, Matthew,eauthor.1 aGazis, Evangelos,eauthor.1 aRhodes, Aidan,eauthor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher.1 z9781788112604 (hardback)40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781788112604/9781788112604.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881126117 a10.4337/97817881126112doi04099cam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002100184245034600205264005100551300003500602336002600637337002600663338003600689490004300725504005100768505162800819520083302447588003903280650003003319655002203349700003003371700003703401710004103438776002903479830004403508856007603552856004203628024003103670eep9781788977845UtOrBLW20190912111033.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190729s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788977845 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aGV716b.H57 201900aHistorical perspectives on sports economics :blessons from the field /cEdited by John K.

It is not mere results, but aspects such as history, statistics, interest in labour markets and finances that often spark people's interest. The characteristics of the sports sector and the data it provides allows economists to cast light on a large number of economic issues facing society. Historical Perspectives on Sports Economics explores a variety of topics, including mega-event analysis, sports governance, anthropometrics, gambling, industrial organisation, infrastructure development and racial issues. The analysis is sufficiently non-technical and will appeal not only to academic economists and students, but to historians and sports enthusiasts as well"--cProvided by publisher.  aDescription based on print record. 0aSportsxEconomic aspects. 0aElectronic books.1 aWilson, John K.,eeditor.1 aPomfret, Richard W.

The first volume presents a variety of perspectives from leading scholars in the field before introducing the basic elements of: risk and uncertainty; information and knowledge; bounded rationality and decision making; motives and incentives; resources and capabilities; and transactions. The second volume looks at how the various elements are integrated into the modern Theory of the Firm with the notion of organization coming increasingly to the fore. It focuses on norms; rules and routines; the entrepreneur; governance; hierarchies; co-operation, teams and networks; innovation and appropriability. Together with an introduction by the editors, this collection is an invaluable reference tool for all researchers and students with an interest in the modern theory of the firm, highlighting how it needs to evolve further to address the important management and policy issues of our time"--cProvided by publisher. 0aBusiness enterprisesxResearch. 0aElectronic books.1 aTeece, David J.,eeditor.1 aKay, Neil M.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781786430694/9781786430694.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817864307007 a10.4337/97817864307002doi10343nam a22003975i 4500001001700000003000800017005001700025006001900042007001500061008004100076020002700117040003200144042000800176050002000184245015500204264005100359300003500410336002600445337002600471338003600497490006400533500012600597504005100723505357900774505408404353505023708437520093408674650002309608655002209631700003109653710004109684830006109725856008609786856004209872024003109914eep9781788119801UtOrBLW20190912111033.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||190730s2019    mau     ob    001 0 eng    a9781788119801 (e-book)  aDLCbengerdacDLCdUtOrBLW  apcc 4aR728b.E47 201900aEmpirical health economics /cEdited by Andrew M.

Health economics provides empirical evidence to aid decision-making across a broad spectrum of issues in health and health care. This evidence is often derived from econometric methods. This title brings together landmark contributions to the development and application of these methods which span the field, ranging from structural models, models for health care costs and other microeconometric approaches, including bayesian methods, longitudinal data, applications to health technology assessment, along with field experiments and policy evaluation. Prefaced by an original introduction from the editor, this collection will be of interest to economic researchers and students as well as health scholar's wishing to explore the development of modern econometrics applied to health policy"--cProvided by publisher. 0aMedical economics. 0aElectronic books.1 aJones, Andrew M.,eeditor.2 aEdward Elgar Publishing,epublisher. 0aInternational library of critical writings in economics.40uhttps://www.elgaronline.com/view/Research_Reviews/9781788119795/9781788119795.xml40uhttps://doi.org/10.4337/97817881198017 a10.4337/97817881198012doi
